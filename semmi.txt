Umven, here is my settings (what disable most of deflection into that IDE):
wtf
mhm, there also is no call of superclass-function: <https://github.com/openfl/lime-samples/blob/master/features/input/GamepadInput/Source/Main.hx#L32>
( or was this inserted by vscodium automatically 😂 =? )
yeah, also wonder why calling the original function from Application-class (super) of that ...
<@689869574883246237> was this also into the lime-sample ?
by testing if / ELSE if .... the problem was when the joystick value goes to `1.0` (then is was set speed to zero curiously)
what me give headache is that there is need 2 if statements in order, e.g. this wasn't working:
```haxe
override function onGamepadAxisMove(gamepad:Gamepad, axis:GamepadAxis, value:Float) {
  super.onGamepadAxisMove(gamepad, axis, value);
        
  if (axis == GamepadAxis.LEFT_Y) {
    if (value > 0.2 ) speedY = value * 5;
    else if (value < -0.2) speedY = value * 5;
    else speedY = 0;
  }
  else if (axis == GamepadAxis.LEFT_X) {
    if (value > 0.2) {speedX = value * 5; }
    else if (value < -0.2) speedX = value * 5;
    else speedX = 0;
  }
}
```
i mean axis only can be the one or the other value ^^
(oh, or is this because of calling `super.onGamepadAxisMove(gamepad, axis, value);` ?)

i am think yesterday the problem was that i am rendered all into blender with only ambient-occlusion and not full lightning (therefor it was not able to find the poses)
yeah, will try that also later sometimes (not sure what all need to install by python there)
oh, there is also another node-based ui for SD .. someones also make char-animations with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4IdHKHrb48&t=1067s
i am think to generate wave-samples its really useful (same as for textures while 3d-modeling, so no need to browse the web anymore if you need some)
but SD is ok ... interesting what they all are doing with that machin (also text and audio at now)
was some years ago into the blender-chat ..there was messages every second ;)

Es macht schon Spass
( <@272509832421179392> and also found the "upscale" tool there at now 😅 )
oh cool .. it also generates the _prompts_ and settings directly into the png-header
<@694560611601743893> now it really needs a little peote-view gallery to let browse them all .. have really to do this!


Mudu, wie findste meine space-bilder ;:) ?
ah, krass was alles möglich ist (hoffentlich auch bald für 3d-modelle \o/)




e.g. my last tryes into starting by 1920x1200 was all looking like this:
yes, but not found really out there yet






not sure also at now how to render into really hight resolution ... cos for more then 1200x1200 the motiv will get not be so good anymore (but sure there is a way to do this from existing lower res)





its really inspiration
can't understand why someone not like that AI 😅


... and ... space is the place ;)
i am really like the fururistic and giger one also ...

yup
needs long time but works
Whats also cool is that you can put an image inside and then let it check what keywords it is would be used for the prompt










i am like that some ones looks really `sureal`:


exactly (was also one of the prompt-keywords there and into most others also 😂 )"!"!"!



also into any style




or to create some graphics for game NPC ...
this will be also very useful for armory textures
i am still at moment to render massive (e.g. 80 while cooking lunch here) .. then i am sorting out (the hardest part cos nearly everyone looks good)

<@694560611601743893> i am fully junky now on this (last nights only some hours of sleep cos of 😂)


ja, aber keine ahnung bisher wie man trainingsdaten eingügt

läuft total gut (muss aber noch mehr lernen, also wie man ein motiv verfeinert usw... gibt auch noch haufenweise extensions dafür, bzw. man kann auch mehere train-modelle vereinen)
nearly all looks really good and only needs some seconds to generate into small resolution
(the large upper ones was generated by some my fractalimages as seed)

(also if you build/publish for html5 or hl->c there will be subfolders created with all [haxe...]->buildfiles)
it only do `make clean` for inside the "build"-folder (that will be named like the `.blend` allways on building)
sometimes it needs also (e.g. if haxecode is changing or maybe also logic-nodes) to press the "clean" button on top-right of blender-armory-ui
3.6. also should work the same (have 3.6.1 here .. there was not much new what affects armory)

( for old _reference-demo_ i am was using 20 of 3960x780 textures and all was run supersmooth even on old android device here ... so theoretically its possible then to have >30 different npc/chars into a game by this framerate & resolution and all normal/uv/depth-maps and all whats need into assetdata )
Tricky will be all how to organize all the _transitions_,
e.g. from walk- to run-cycle and to the other poses whats need into a game.
For a game-proto Half, i am thing 16 frames is best. For different walkstyles and all kind of anims then for 64x64 imagesize per frame it could store 16 different ones into a 1024x1024 texture 🙂 !
( tryed to immitate old walkstyle of <@689869574883246237> but did not get it fullylike  ;:)
*lol
i am think it swings _littleBitToMuch_ at now with the body 😂

thx (did also anotherone with more natural walkstyle but theres also totally 🍝 now into dopesheet *LOL ;:)

16 frames is enough 🙂
machs gut ~~
ne, die mesh muss sich oben mehr mitdrehen

Problem ist auch noch in den weightnings wenn ich den Oberkörper zu stark drehe:
In den Spritesheets brauch ich auch wahrscheinlich die Arme und den Kopf als extra Assets ... muss da erstmal mehr rumprobieren jetze ;)
Er muss auch vom "gehen" zum "stehen" kommen und sich dann zum Betrachter umdrehen um in die rest-pose-anim zu kommen!
(will nur 16, 12 oder am besten 8 frames haben .. dann aber mehrere Variationen... also nur Seitenansicht fürn 2D-game-environment)
Will als nächstes erstmal versuchen das rauszurendern um zu schauen wie es in der gameengine und mit weniger frames aussieht
hab erstmal nur die Schultern etwas angepasst ... ist ja erstmal nur die `basis`!


hey <@642308650463002626> 😂 ... hab heut den ganzen Tag _rumgeriggt_ (nun endlich auch die Arme perfect ;:)
good that you are using it also now, so 4 eyes is looking on and maybe more could be improved or renamed ... there is also a way now to make it better together with z-ordering + alpha-blending (what no need to render2texture but also into 3 Program-steps into order!)
(everyone can implement now own "BlendMode"s without a namespace-conflict ;:)
ok, i am renamed _`BlendMode`_ into `BlendFactor` at now!
there is still to much "fix"-commits anyway 😂 <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master>
*hugs
yeah .. for local trunk is really good to have!
(then we better see later updates into "steps" for!)
(pls don't forgot also a "git rebase" befor pushing up 😅)
yeah ... make it simple and good comments still need its time 💓
(no rush !!!)
(pls keep also the old "shader"-way!)
🪩 \o/yeah
Where was your old sample for making the light for the foreignSquatsch-guy who was using into game-proto .. i mean where you did it per shadercode and FBO?
(and "func" sounds better than "equation" i am think!)
yeah ...we have (for "BlendFunc") now: ADD, SUBTRACT, REVERSE_SUBTRACT, MIN and MAX
So no one will be confused with blend-"mode" from photoshop or flash etc. into layers there!
ah .. ok.. then better i am let it "Func" cos its more whats calles "the opengl->equatation" at that place ...
(maybe what i am called "Func" should be the "Mode" 😂 ?)
here is to see full new API at now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/BlendAlphaMode.hx#L100>
Do you think it better have to _rename_ at now (before later into 20 samples where it is used 😂 ) ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/shaders/normals/src/NormalLight.hx#L93>
so `.ONE` is "1.0"
result into: `colorDestination * 1.0` `+` `colorSource * 1.0`
```haxe
// blending to "add" multiple lights
program.blendEnabled = true;
program.blendSrc = BlendFactor.ONE;
program.blendDst = BlendFactor.ONE;
```
yeah, it maybe have to renamed to:
so Dst is all what was already drawn and Src is how new light is drawing on top
```haxe
// blending to "add" multiple lights
program.blendEnabled = true;
program.blendSrc = BlendMode.ONE;
program.blendDst = BlendMode.ONE;
```
mhm... Halfwheat, instead of `BlendMode`.. should i am better rename the haxe-type into: `BlendFactor` ?
(cos its _really_ the multiplication "factor" into colorformula at the end!)

oh, now also things can be _blended_ like for slideshow ;:)
Anyway, have to check _ALL_ samples tomorrow cos this now breaks code ;)
[everywhere its using "alpha" or "alphaEnabled" it have to replace by "blend..."]
<https://john-wigg.dev/2DMetaballs/>
https://john-wigg.dev/2DMetaballs/assets/merge.gif
wonder can make something like this at now:
ok, all renamed and cleaned up .)
Should i am better rename all into "Dest" there into api to "Dst" also ? (more near to that opengl-Enums then!)
mhm... wonder how i can draw "metaballs" now 😂 with that (or is that only possible by shader)
"source" there is allways the factor for what is drawing up on top
its _implemented_ 😅 : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/bba1ec0a3b1e9f3390a47cb7ef8fcd0a62119f37> (what a mess*lol ;:)
🙂 ( better than only alpha on/off :)
<@694560611601743893> so this will be API for full blend-mode-implementation into peote-view:
```hx
program.blendEnabled = true; // false by default

// --- value for constant blend-color ---

```
1) writing the ui-`samplecode` (to let change blend-mode e.g. to simmulate `2D-metaballs` also;)
2) implementing into peote-view (and no stop until samplecode not working ready into API-calls .)
todo something like this is `still` my _longterm_ plan: <https://www.andersriggelsen.dk/glblendfunc.php>
now it only needs something "to select" 😂  (wanna use next time for last basefeature into peote-view before i am putting into `haxelib` at `0.99` ;:)

<@272509832421179392> guck mal, ui hat nun auch einen "select"-prototyp:

it works ...my first "pose" into asset-lib .)
very useful for game-assets later 😍
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rcqlpsMO4
so this i am will try out next to get into practice:
What found useful also into new features is into blenders "Asset"-lib nowa ... e.g. you can easy manage your _poses_  (creates also little cam-rendered-icons of any you store into ... automatically!)
smoothing is only by subdivision-modifier on top of (and smooth-shading-enabled)



now better ~~

see You ( miss you at now .)
you have my
(so later only _changing_ there!)
all "hacks" have to -> `concentrate` into -> one `file` (by haxe!)
we should keep it _readable_
i mean into our haxelime code
if there is "hacks" into -> they have to be easy to located later!
years i mean!
also into mind to what will work over the next

not for into our holy hx and lime spice here i mean.

ah, what kind of "smell" ?
if not into good human society
i am hate it totally (into job - money - endlesshittyloop)

🙈
SHIT
and the one who wrote old code you build up is still there to work together into migration and up-building ?
or by yourself from beginning ?
and you have to build up on some ones other code ?
(a little deal)
nah, maybe thats K then

you should TELL your BOSS who is really the

ah
(me not meet much others since i am more at home-computers)
oh, what was going on into busyness ?
i am will not left you alone onto way!
Or that `rust` is the -> holy grail at now into ^^
that `haxe` also not getting any further there * ~~~ (not sure into what there is plan or maybe into 5 only)
its also no shame i am think ...
not js alone there ... its all into `parallele computing` into general
javascript _hurts_ me *lol
as into what there is going on into -> browser-code <- _nowa_ 😁
Also into OpenFL it would be `read` more easy!
<@231149223855390721> <https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/main/src/experiments> the `code` there is 🍝 into `diff` to what works by peote and lime-based at now into supersimple sample!
i mean: what we have into haxe here is miles away from what some developers-by-google-chrome is at now into `experimenting` only :)
(for the next "webGPU"-hype;:)
as what e.g. the "chrome"-developers did for its browser and into "experimental"-folder only
And our `haxelimepeote` based samplecode looks much more simple and easy to read and to understand
<@694560611601743893> also remember that we was the first ones who did crosstarget sound-wave-generation by GPU (let me have it crosstarget at first .... pleeeeaaase *hugs ;:)!
(also some little breaking-changes into peote-view for the last time into _glsl-blendmode_ and _texture-param-API_!)
and what need to -> `finished` finally!
shader-editor -> ALSO ;:)
(frequency and other params have to change at runtime again -> interactively!)
into haxechat 😂
wanna put old fractal-generated-soundwave DEMO sometimes
lets concentrate back into audio and graphics .)
)
(will continue there later!!! ->
also into "web" its more motivating me to work on if i can make some little demo then sometimes
you are true
yeah ... more and more i am think thats all the old LLVM what gets its `fruits` at now .)
<@231149223855390721> is it relative easy to make also a `trisitter` extension?
( the thing is that it is into rust *lol .... but for wasm is also exported to c code i am think to that could be possible into some ⛓️) ... need that for peote-ui text-field and syntax-hl.
and audio into cpp-targets 😂
*lol ... have trisitter into web-only at now ...
mhm, at first trisitter need to be a lime-native-extension ...
thats no problem ... we can do like into `trisitter`-sample then!
What i am _familiar_ into since haxe is limes `Future`s
into worklet i am lack much into async (never did much into js-land there before ... my way is to `fork` new processes from perl and c only into .)
i get stuck into that i am have to create so often new "source" instances into the web-one
(that i can extend into peote-audio for!)
(to test separate at first ... and then simple api for both!)
like the  `sinequeue.hx` at now
yeah -> best to have simplest way
was testing your openAL-buffering-method now really often and also think its good solution .... not tryed more into web-audio yet
and also without `worklet` for ?
is this faster by wasm for low-latency-performance into webbrowser i am was asking me after all.
Whats also allways asking me since looking into how to get webaudio-wavesynth by that _reference-samples_ of chrome-developers there into `audioworklet` ... why they using also WASM (or why need) to have a `ringbuffer` into that _audiothread_ for js ^~
Half, do you tested already ... audio or other of your limecode by wasm 🤩 now?
How is going on into `lime run wasm` (thats really awesome now .. allways now play into mind how would be run into the 2 peote-view bunnymarks 😍 )
wanna make all at the end into peote-audio wrapper (to have simple API and same output for html5 and the native buildtargets)!
(and some years later into openfl i am remember i get the float32-dataformat also not really to run .. any ... now it WORKS \o/ ♥️ ❤️)
it was so easy into flashplayer at that time
old `LyapunovSoundSynthHaxePoly.swf` here was last time for me into 2013: http://maitag.de/semmi/
Joshua, i am soo happy also to get back that old feeling into sound-generation at runtime \o/ (even if only into OpenAL at now)
anyway ...
(think its since time where i am also had installed skype here and by installing visual-c-community-edition it asking me to connect by that to -> cloud-service-whatever 🙈 )=
Have still that old prbl. since years that if i am build cpp by haxe here it still get hang until i am kill "powershell"-process by taskmanager
wanna install and harden that 10 into a week and then no think about (if all buildchains is running again into same [or better.. not sure;]
->workflow<-
(need a blender-bountytrunk also for win7 since month now!)
this year will be the last time i can test on win7 here 😂
```haxe
public static inline var FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32:Int = 0x10010;
public static inline var FORMAT_STEREO_FLOAT32:Int = 0x10011;
```
so i am only would do a pull to acomplish here: <https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/src/lime/media/openal/AL.hx#L49>
i mean it seems already hidden enabled here ( the openal-sample works )
😂 there you have to ask <@694560611601743893> for ~_~
but why it even works for openAL float32 i mean if i am using the integer-value ?
cool
ah, so simmiliar to opengl-extensions ? (that one i am using some off .. e.g. also the ones for float-textures!)
aahh... so it detect on demand ?
never worked with cpp-extensions yet into lime or openfl (thats a totally mysterium for me)
OH \o/ ... inside of Mojo it should work the same: <https://github.com/openfl/libmojoal/blob/4dfbb1b08bc830bf90ec9687435bd955db5380ed/mojoal.c#L78>
its there but maybe by extension: <https://github.com/openfl/libopenal/blob/9b3a80d8a87831be66f7130d582b7ad92f82f054/include/AL/alext.h#L67>
mhm, sounds good <https://github.com/openfl/lime/tree/develop/project/lib> cos there is a folder called "OpenAL32" 🙂 ... anyway, have also no iphone here to test out
oh, interesting (while looking into Build.xml now) is that it still using the origin OpenAL version on iphone || webassembly (maybe there it is not working with Float32Array then)
(or by : `<set name="LIME_MOJOAL" value="1" \>` into line 26)
yes, i am think it will be automatically used if build `-static` also
mhm, was somewhere here as i am remember: <https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/project/Build.xml#L26>
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/webAndOpenAL/src/PeoteAudio.hx#L113>)
By the way, do you tested out the `openAL` sample where it is using `Float32Array`-bufferdata also into "Mojo"-AL version ? (we have to extend the enums then into lime for `AL.FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32` and stereo!)
fun would be to have some peote-net multiplayer-sample where everyone can paint onto surface
So only one click and it have to generate all and start the peote-sample to let easy preview into 2D + dynamic lights and uv-mapping for a custom surface-texture.
at the end it will also need a little pythonscript again to render all frames and starting imagemagic to put into spritesheet
👯‍♂️
that will be _definitively_ shaking again (^_^)
jo, after all is _weightned_ to the mesh and into control-rig (rigify-addon) its hard to change then afterwards to make also a more _normal_ walk
now into hope the straight legs will make it better into walk (without bowlegs ;)

was starting again with a new meta-rig 😅 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbkdFfQsBKk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB90kgSnqFE
(to get same into buffer-queue-sample you was _finalizing_)
(all i am tryed there at now didn't _run_ 💧 )
<@694560611601743893> i am need your help to *hugs (web-js and into asys makes me totally confusing)
Joshua, i am really at that point to have to clone myself also at now because i can't solve all my `ideas` into `one` lifetime .)
3.) -> i am have to implement it (can't do that holy kind of soundwavegeneration by myself [graphic is ok .. but now i am at limit ~~])
2.) motivating
1.) inspirating
all the birds here i am hear singing what is still alive
and don't get `deflected` only cos its _springtime_ here like into
`every year` :) ..... my old friend joshua...
🔌
_coding together_ -> much harder into nowadays "wire"-times
`friend-code` -> hard to find
(or where you working very hard over years and at the end the "boss" tell you that you are get "fired" .-. w t . . .)
(not like for "job" or "profit" i mean into where all need to be as fast as possible into sell)
so _amazing_ \o/ .. i am LOVE it!
nowadays into blender it is such like easy as how into haxelime to keep code longstable running and places to build up on at any time i mean ..
<@231149223855390721> do you remember how hard it was into adobe cs4 and later to make sucha `walkcycle` into pure 2D ?

Much more _fun_ i am get into latest blender->mind-refreshing here into old "walk".-c y c l e ...
all is rendering also 30h into `still`-asset-one
[for `custom` formula `on demand`... u know]
(need a new graphic-card here to get better into exploring...
 ... even into blender and OSL ("open"shaderlanguage) protocol..
.. really not get it working on my old COMPUTER here at now -_-)

now with all passes:

basic up/down/pass walkcycle ( now it needs tuning :)

jo (like all into)
\o/
(you can also play your animation while editing the mesh and sucha spice.)
that feature is inside there since so long now!
we could `edit` together also !
like throught ssh-filesystem or something .)
(e.g. if the `meshdata` is saved .. the other one have it on demand while editing!)
into -> `network`
while another one using that mesh for animation-posing-workflow
so one could edit the mesh-data all the time ...
i could make also 2 files over a `proxy` thing there
into general into blender i mean ...
do you know what is cool into blender now :)?
that would be really a mess i mean with all fingers and face-IK
I am also not did with the `FULL`->metarig ...
(and keep the vertex-weights!)
i mean for the riggy-addon
good is that i am can re-create all again very easy
but now its done and maybe i see more glitches later into animation-try
maybe there is better way as into changing the geometry of mesh

ok, seems FIXed now:
knotted to arm again .)


needs a little -> _handtransplantation_
the coders from google maybe not fixed that (or only for chrome)
yeah, thats understandable
or into multisource-instancing all the time ?
allways getting auditable glitches ?
don'T know how to fix it by "riggify"-addon
(like a reboot then to generate that control-rig again)
yes ... better i am change the geometry of the mesh i am think
should be rotated to where the hand is
the `red` control-IK-resolver there for the hand

whats wrong is that i am have some control-joints whats wrongTwisted
ganz genau .)
(into workflow ... much things need to _repeat_ to test out bone-repositioning + vertex-weightning at bone-place .. and then reset all to rest-pose)
What i am not fully _Checked Out_ for myself is FK->IK and IK->FK 😂
before creating that final "control-rig"
there its much better explained how to position the meta-rigbones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9nLir_LMBU
found also a new tutorial into german 😂 :

to relax i did some blender last hours ... to finetune the "rig" again *lol
by "sharedArrayBuffer" i am think (only write by one and read by otherone!) it should be best into performance (the worklet-processor only should send back by post-msg then how many it was pulling out or something so we know into main-thread if msg-queue need new sound-wave-data)
(maybe they have only bug into sample there cos of that errors)
latest

but into sample here into firefox i get error "failed to pull" : <https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/free-queue/examples/simple-passthrough/>
<https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/main/src/audio-worklet/free-queue/src/free-queue.js>
Maybe using this to `push` data from main-thread to let it `pull` by worklet-processor into audiothread?
can we not do like here: <https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/main/src/audio-worklet/basic/hello-audio-worklet/> ... so the Oscillator-nodes `output` there is `input[0]` of audioworklet .... i am wonder how to fill the worklet-input without "connecting" to any node
(a shame!)
webdevelopement is ONLY->Hacks
(so most near to openal-bufferqueue-approach would be by worklet)
what i am not like is that you can not reuse a "source" there
( found allways "scriptProcessor"-node and whatever or also that its "deprecated" and so on .. wtf )
mhm, why i can't find an usable sample into web for doing same by webaudio 😢
do you get it to run or is it more tricky on webaudio (e.g. for latency)?
~~better for _showcase_ 🪗
but first -> web <-
*lol
(also for stereo!!! ;:)
that forgotten flags .)
we should commit into AL.hx of lime-repo!
jo
needs only same into block-`queuing` for WebAudio now and can update the shader and  PeoteAudio Wrapper for frequency-change at runtime (^_^)
So same data-precision now on WebAudio and OpenAL 🙂 ...
( same on windows/linux  ... we need to test on android sometimes .)
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/8724d8e9ebe50188cbb38aa7cf236b1eb525e5a1> works
HA... it works 😂 ... by `0x10010`
and a lime rebuild
or it need to enable that openAl-_extension_
maybe joshua only forget it into haxe lime bindings at that time and all works by using: `0x10010` for `AL.FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32`
yes, all is "openal-soft" now ...
(into the c-bindings there is no `AL.FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32`)
but how to enable it 🙂 ?
oh, after searching: <https://github.com/openfl/libopenal/search?q=AL_FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32> it seems by extension or something we should be able to also using float32 textureData directly for OpenAL
(by glsl later i will do extra-smooth between the `block`s .)
wow, also into 120FPS and sample_rate / 32 you nearly don't listen the _ladder_-effect 🙂
(have to cook for lunch here also now .. seeYou ~~)
🪗
what ?
if we have same for web-audio i can put  all into the wrapper again 🙂
if mouse moves very fast .. the little 🪜 -effect is still listening ... really cool (totally continue-wave if mouse moves very slow .. like a Theremin \o/)
```haxe

        block.set(n++, sample >> 8);
    }
}
```
here it is: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth/wavechunks>
(needs some little optimization first ;)
moment, will commit it
super SMOOTH now \o/
YEAH
(so instead of "last_"-params it need only that "position_offset"!)
(still have a bug .. need to accumulate the "offset" all the time to get it work)
ok, now only the new formula
frequencyHz = freq is need also cos i am not sure that if you move the mouse and it is inside the loop already
```haxe
function fill_samples(sample_count:Int, block:Bytes) {
   last_position = position;
   var frequencyHz = freq; // to not change while generating one block
   n = 0;
   for(i in 0...sample_count){
      sample = Std.int(32767.0 * sine(last_freq, frequencyHz, last_position, position++, sample_rate));
      block.set(n++, sample);
      block.set(n++, sample >> 8);
   }
   last_freq = frequencyHz;
}
```
ok, i am at here now:
AudioWorklet only if AudioBuffer not works!
anyway, after viewing js-src there my mind feels like 🍝 :)
(by a sharedArrayBuffer or something ... if all common browsers is supporting that)
(did not work here into firefox but we should do same as how they fill the worklet-thread via that FastQueue-helper or into simmiliar way!)
<https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/main/src/experiments>
apropos, last time i am looked for audioworklet i found also a WebGPU-experiment there into its REPO 😂
jo.. we have to generate all in depend of "deltaTime" !
anyway, will try out the new formula (there it need a `last_position` and `last_frequency` param only!)
[all tested into neko only]
but we can set fps to 120 *lol (then "deltaTime" is 6-9 ms)
OH
(without "fps" the default seems: 30 also!)
if <window ... fps="60"> .... for fps="30" its also double time
mhm, delta-time really is between 15 and 17 here (neko)
.. was it contineously there or by haxe-timer into background 😅
mhm, totally forgot at what "time" into lime the onUpdate is fire ...
ah yeah, ok... that all looks more _streamed_ now
e.g. the onUpdate producing more data-blocks into queue than audio can play into that deltaTime?
another thing is, if using more blocks ... could it grow endless ?
ah ok
mhm, maybe the block-data have to be a little bit larger or something ... or all delayTime-related
into onUpdate(deltaTime) ... should the buffer-queue not be allways filled up continuously and allways a little bit _before_ all buffers are empty ?
```haxe
        // source will stop if buffers have finished so test and keeping it playing here
        if (AL.getSourcei(source, AL.SOURCE_STATE) != AL.PLAYING) {
            AL.sourcePlay(source);
        }
```
wonder about here:
... so the `finished_buffers` array there contains all the buffers whats already played ?
Ok, i am back and tested the buffer-queuing now ... yes, its really audible that sin-wave with new frequency is not continue ... now we have to try out Pafnutys formula there.
good way now into OpenAL ... that gimme new hope to finish that samples there like planed into origin
will test this way also ( but later, have to get out for some fresh air now ;)
oh, so 48000 is not for 1 second ?
jo, to continuously generate the wave is np
will try that also later ( oh, so 1/16 second blocks)
ah, this looks better into buffer-chunks!
i gived up last time into `Audioworklet` for web
lets look what others would say about what we are talking here
🐅
wilderness
lets look into open-area
*hugs
(pls)
let jump into hx->chan (there is some unanswered questions for me.)
no
-> shit on how `implementation` and into what of `language` .)
(or was talking into real or chat!)
what we did `together` never gets lost
you fell "alone" here old friend to have to -> `pin` something .) ?
(also how `babelfish` is _doing_ nowa )
not that i need a `formula` for such kind of ... but truely .... ~~ :;)
<@272509832421179392> do you know what i mean (what hard to explain by words) ?=
https://youtu.be/UgQanZlkybI?t=850
fully into `math` - `way` i mean ( base->WAVE have to be `fullystable` [other things than can be "modulated" on top by peote-view new `blend`->formula! )
My goal have to be to make a soundwave - generation by Formula-INPUT !
but sometimes i am really `missing` that also!
(so happy that all my "exame"-times is away and no more stressfully `math-exploring` i mean <@539190724030103553> \ \ \ |)
that i can'T dig it above to surface at any time i am need
but so much deep nested into neurone-tree
sorry but my _math_ is really still existend (not like into of <@694560611601743893> s ones *lol+hugs ;:)
😂
for what do you was need this one into kind of formula i mean ?

as i am into sound-wave i mean
What is really fun for me is that you have simmiliar problem into math
E
X

<@539190724030103553> coding and math at moment is more turning my mind around
I am think i should try to upload some emocticon graphics sometimes ....(if ascii not enough anymore i am `really` NEED ;:)
(shortcut!)
and the babelfish translate command here is only `/tr`
🪩 -> extra `lightning` 😂
only rule is -> not installing some extensions what will "spy" more (we only tryed out gpt and deepl into here at now)

Welcome into our little `chamber` here \o/
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth>
jo, did all committed (lets send via causual-chan *lol :;)
🙈 wft, i am see also your good comment about into samplecode *lol
(i am think this it have to be cos it not play sound ... maybe that browser-security-shit)
woah, i am did not get it run on html5 without mouse-event
anyway, will continue after lunch (cooking potato-soup now!)
(or ALL by peote-audio at the end 😂 ?)
by using lime audio api for
mhm, but what if we wanna play music into background later
ah, cos lime is doing that behind the wheels already for ?
maybe later! .. i do it as simple as possible at first
```haxe
var device = ALC.openDevice();
var context = ALC.createContext(device);

ALC.makeContextCurrent(context);
ALC.processContext(context);
``` so there you can switch between multiple audioContext
for OpenAL it needs this to init:
ok, better will make it static then
only need to know for the _Wrapper_ ,.,, to make it a static var into that case
Half, do you know if it is possible to use multiple `var audio:AudioContext;` into WebAudio ? (or only one allowed at the same time?)
later all can be made also _extrasmooth_ by doing a transition (hope the  _2*pi-phase_ not also have to be to put into calculation .)
(where shader also using the time-uniform to connect the wave-chunks at the correct point)
will first make a new sample there where is little OpenAL/WebAudio wrapper and continue-play by Timer \o/
yeah, it works: <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/isktu8looo> 🙂
\o/ many thanks (ah, you set it into equation)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwdJgxdPKgs
<@272509832421179392> guck mal was wir hier gemacht haben (^^)-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth>
(so into ~1h lets meet into causual-channel to continue there 😍)
(read pixels of float32 texture also implemented now and all works here \o/)
not sure ... will eat lunch now and then i commit it to test out
now into float32-textures you see it!
(an old `hack` for older Browser 🙈)

Whoah ... found the glitch into my shader-code:
(here is good weather .. will go out a bit)
jo.. will at first improve the shader so all is float32 tonight ..
but that is more what should be on top of after i am think .. anyway .)
the other frequency what is modulating .. thats what i am also thought after looking that video..
yeah, no rush ...
anyway 😂  ... will calculate that out later !
( together with a smooth transition inside start of chunk-B so that the curve smoothly change its shape to the new one )
for e.g. `sin(x * 1.0)` to `sin(x * 2.0)` at point x into coordinate system i am think it needs some _shifting_ like:
`sin( (x + shift) * frequency )` ... and then calculating the "shift"-value from frequency-Red to new frequency-Blue
(by "fourier transformation"-way that would be a lesser problem but that ones isn't good to calculate by glsl)

do you not think it have to be shifted into some way for the next chunk with blue-frequency 😅
mhm, not sure
yes, but not from one sinus to the next if both have different "frequency" ( into green time-range where chunks put together at some timestep)
where we can maybe using the buildin glsl `smoothStep()` only to make a smooth transition between both curves
it have to be more smooth between both curves there i am think from kind of math
I mean even if the blue curve is shifted a little bit to the left (so the endpoints connect),
that into video its not what i am wanna do (into video i am only like how to modulate the input of frequency later automatically)
it have to be some easy way to "connect" them
if we have more complicate formulas later where more params is changed by uniforms

(yeah, x is allways the time!)
mhm, i am think how to implement into glsl ... maybe by `smoothStep` or simmiliar to interpolate from one to other smoothly
and if frequency is changed from one chunk to the next one
i mean think like the formula is: `sin(x * frequency)`
the blue is higher freq. .. and have to continue the red one

e.g. if we change the frequency by mouse-position every 1/60 second
yes, but think like the first chunk is end at value 0.5 and the second starts at 0.0 again
(the curve have to shift then so start and end points of both curves have to be the same value)
so that the next chunk is exactly fit to the previously
Not sure at now how todo if we have little 1/60 second chunks and frequency is modulated at runtime ...
jo, by at least 2 curves it should be
Half, looked last night how to improving the GPU-sound sample, i am think it should be like this into some way:
https://youtu.be/hQYtRhQPcyY?t=106
<@694560611601743893> https://youtu.be/C3Ew3BjB56Q?t=215

what the overfuckingbullshitF U C K ... <@215582414544699393> .. at this moment i am wanna `ping` you from into nbs-haxe-chan and i am can't find you there ... was that to much stupidiness there for you also ? (will leaving that _Chan_ also sometimes)
💯 ... ♥️  ♥️  ♥️
fully into `sync` to the smooth graphic-transitions into peote-view!
Wanna have best way to let generate and mix on GPU!
e.g. like into this sample: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Advanced_techniques#the_noise_%E2%80%94_random_noise_buffer_with_a_biquad_filter>
(cos now TextureData is all the haxe-arrays it needs to transform for limes openAL-lime-arraybuffer ones 🙈 )
<@694560611601743893> as i am see you speaking about OpenAL and i am tryed also now i still found a bug into sample-repo: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/c24901b019aa798be2d1b63ecf7231cb897a68a3>
have to cook also for lunch now 🙂
So now ConstraintSet is completely `static` again: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-layout/commit/36f748e7dba57208160595e66c67411541636e75>
it needs 5 seconds (to that case it not good to add/remove inner stuff later .)

anyway ... on neko to `init()` all the constraints like here:
seeYou later (did optimized all now to use a fully static ConstraintSet again ;)
where it not will need much time to "change" layout or "add/remove" new tree-leafes (to recalculate the constraints-set again on every add/remove/layoutchange i mean)
but inside one of the tree-nodes there another small one in chain
and then it is more flexible again also to make a supercomplex (long time to init) layout..
so that will be cool to make a "cassowary"-> ⛓️
hey, what i am will try soon there is to make the `LayoutContainer` an `Layoutable` also itself
peote-layout is the most CRYPTIC code maybe i am ever wrote 🤣
also +tree-traversing
yeah, everything into
any, have back _control_ now of the cassowary-constraining there and it works good!
*lol -> even that is still a mess-of-complicated-code 🙈
.. at now it still storing 2 of "constraints" per element (to let remove) but can do make all fully `static` there at now (maybe a little bit more faster then)
but was also not for nothing (have better tool since that to make the maincode smaller: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-layout/blob/main/src/peote/layout/util/ConstraintSet.hx>
was getting _really stuck_ there last time so better to remove it (even if it was taken a week of work or so at that time)
-> total MESS 😂 <https://github.com/maitag/peote-layout/commit/f62688878c66dc3679a4a03c2a60a9b0a7412a7f>
And if someone really have to make much add/remove layoutelements into layout-tree at runtime it can be optimized later by breaking the contraints-tree into 2 or something (or using non-layout inside of!) .. peote-ui also will have soon the hook for `LayoutElement`s to mix all together now into more easy way.
but NOW code is much less complicate again and the most important: it works *lol ;:)
now if you add/remove layout-childs it have to build up the fully constraints-system again (so 2.5 recursive looping throught the fully tree can take longer time!)
did that TRY to make it faster but anyway .)
eh, but into layout i am removed all the messy-code (what still was not finished) to add/remove layoucontainers into an already running constraints-system....
ah, interesting (payment is allways good to have, i am never had to do for kind of this into web)
<@694560611601743893> last night i refactored `peote-layout` to make it more slim again

I am think i should do all that `super-layout-refactoring` later and only _rename_
mhm.. all is really hard to mix together
Need something into what is "widget" at now to `abstract cast` it in@to `interactive` UIElement baseclass to let `add` it to the PeoteUIDisplay ...

        ...        
        
        // events
        onPointerUp:   () -> { ... },
        onPointerDown: () -> { ... },
    }),
    
    new LayoutRow( { width:Size.limit(100,600) },
    [
        new LayoutArea( ... )
            ...
    ]),
    
])
```
mhm, will first try out like this:
e.g. like `UIElement(...).layout({})` what creates a `LayoutContainer`-Type automatically ... not sure ~~
Maybe also better way ...
y, no hurry ... i am only thinking again how to make it best wrapped by new abstract around that Layoutcontainer from peote-layout
<@694560611601743893> did updated also the old sample for using peote-layout without any _wrappers_ <https://github.com/maitag/peote-layout/tree/main/samples/peote-ui/src>
anyway.. needaSleep (^_^) -> seeYa ~~
not sure with the "naming" at now
(if UIArea is resized .. the layout will _rearrange_ all what is inside its layout-tree)
or can _add_ to an UIArea
this can be _add_ then like any UI-Element to the PeoteUIDisplay (need to rename this then into PeoteUI only!)
```haxe
new UILayout( BOX, { width:Size.limit(100,600) },
[
    new TextPage(... , 
        { 
            width:Size.limit(100,600),
            height:Size.limit(100, 400),
        },
        {
            onPointerUp:   () -> { ... },
            onPointerDown: () -> { ... },
        }
    ),
    ...,
    ...
])
```
on my TODO here last idea was like this:
Good will be to let all -> `mix` .) .. the static pixel one like now and the peote-layout one!
Bottleneck into layout only is if you add/remove elements into that TREE then (it have to recalculate the cassowary for full experience ... have some optimization still inside but not fully .. its another approach)
lemme try to implement that a bit cleaner as it is working at now (into other samplefolder there is one working-thing already!)
(to not scale buttons to small or something on touch-devices)
best also that you can define min and max size
(and you have h- and v-boxes)
so if you say { left:0 } -> its on the right side allways of parent-container
and would have a greater config per element what including the events and layout-options...
but wanna have it inside a UI-Element like the others
its still using the existing ui-elements (but wrapped around)
`UILayout` element!
Wanna try to make that API clear there next weeks
for android cool will be with `layout` ...
(if you make game and it goes slow -> 1000 particles lesser for older hardware and everything is ok .)
better little bit slower but more and easy to target all devices
like lime have.
heaps also have not all that into crosstargets i mean
(easyer to build for all targets)
better would be into lime
only we need it *lol
no idea
Also for android it was on signmajestys todolist 7 years ago .)
so all what using SDL
zeta means on linux natives it should be there (but wasnt here into haxelib-version as i am tested)
Maybe its need new SDL or something .. don't know who is working on there.
only hope that `lime` will hover more to es3 also (out of html5)
i am happy into that ES2/3 for easy doing all now by peote-view
(HIP is for AMD ... oneAPI for intel[xeHPG-architecture] .)
was trying OptiX here last time but din't work for my OSL shaders 😢

i am only know cos into blender over the years the list there into system-settings was growing also
every years something new maybe for new gpu-generation/manucaturer ;)
e.g. OptiX or something
or also other new for using gpu better for _computing_
on native there is also much stuff .. e.g. CUDA
jo
(instead of "render2texture" for a new renderpass)
-> stay on GPU
the better there is to let the .. e.g. FBO things
all much complicate
jo.. thats the newer opengl "compute shaders"
and if somewhere is vulkan or parallele-rendering/buffering its another approach and not easy to hook in
into kha i am think would be more complicate cos all so much graphics-modes (also anyone!) .. not sure there at now how to mix ... maybe better peote-view there inside into some way
(would be interest for armory for me only)
we can have heaps inside a peote-view `Display` also (e.g. to render 3D .)
heaps renderengine also looks clean ... only how it is mixed the H2d with the H3d was looking little 🍝 for me
yep (the old flash-api is to much _ballast_ sometimes.. thats why peote-view was started at that time .. and mostly all devices have opengl nowadays)
\o/
cool ... turbopixel .)
(after some setup it can be really fit all there into UI to make it a pixel-art-tool also!)
ha ha .. yes :) .. or use also blender
so for filebrowsing and simmiliar.
cool also would be a `tree-browser`
I am need to hook the `peote-layout` some better inside and then its base-features all works stable and can write more useful _widgets_ (e.g. a selectbox-thing)
now with peote-ui all goes better and better
(cooler would be own chat by peote-net .)
yes, i am also have much other things todo
but would be possible and best solution (no need to castrate haxe for "bad code" then anymore!)
jo 🙈
there is also `sessionhandling`
was sometimes looking already (much js there what need to reverse-engeneer to see what is the @formular-get/post values back to server)
What more cool would be to only using the base-construct .. 
but then let using the real haxe-compiling job do by try.haxe.org http-access and fetching results (+macro!) from there.
yep -> bountybranch <- *lol
We should also let run the `haxebot` here 🙂 !
Before someone installing new addons, we should discuss about first !
(Don't wanna have insecure-, tracker- or spyware things here what stealing our accounts or something!)
you can pin it also now .)
perfect 💋
mhm, still some regression-glitches into alignning .. anyway, will fix that later!
to scroll the textline if not autowidth
same like into edit-page ... you can have a slider i mean (e.g. if need on touch or somewhere)
Also since haxe 4.31 its better to put `<haxedef name="no-deprecation-warnings" />` into project.xml
You can also bind a hSlider ;)
... maybe some regression-bugs .. have to test more later!
yep, it have all the keyboard-actions and better selection(by timer) also now...
ok, its `done` (what a mess *lol :;)-><https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/commit/1baf3555f5783e411c1b60bb266c69bc64e618ee>
ah cool (also for linux?)
<@694560611601743893> don't wanna make all that of effort for more models 😂 ( feel allways slow into that but it goes on ... i am hope more fun later into peote-sample if that one is _dancing_ :;)

anyway ... to relax from coding i am did little rigging again .. need to fix more of vertex-weights for the bones
🛒
<@215582414544699393> i am also `banned` from `main` haxe channel or old NME one there 😭 (->fucking admins everywhere<-)
never was into "celeste net chat" .. what is that ?
Anyway -> at the end each asset-tile should be only prepared for 128x128 ( tile-overlapping included )
... but not sure yet how to make that without to much effort (^_^)
... have to find good way to let the `tiles` somekind of _meltogether_ at the borders
wanna make good light and tile-able ENV for that little char also for peote-view

<@215582414544699393> at now i am still experimenting/play into blender again 😅 ...
(was only refactoring peote-ui API last time ... now all is more coherent into configuring the different ui-elements ... only need a better way now to include the peote-layout again directly into that workflow [don't wanna have extra-workflow anymore into auto-scalable-layouting like it works at now there])
np, also not playing vallheim so often (would also setup dedi server there but to much steam-stuff will be need ;) ... oh, your minecrafthost was down ?
<@689869574883246237> <@215582414544699393> what goes on into minecraft buildings ? 
-> do we are living into _another worlds_ 😅 ...
Bulby, do you also play that game "Vallheim" ? (my faforite game last years)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKFBWDMreb4
nice camfly!
<@272509832421179392> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502857487888809985/1097381651023143042/blender_stc9kmvQYZ.gif
maybe only the "head" and "body" should be separate assets (to let combine later) or what do you think?
Not sure at now how i can make best of `variation` of body-parts and walk-type and so on
(e.g. if the sprite is 64x64 or 128x128 pixels at the end)
Was looking much howTo some ones is doing for unreal-engine .. i am think for 2D all can be much faster and easy to create
hey -> face into my char will be only -> animated texture at runtime! (into peote-view by uv-runtimemapping!)
(never had so much fun into blender again since long ;:)
😂

how is -> `soundlib` matchingTheTargets ?
allways _Crazy_ there _How_ i am `like`
(was in pub)
jo
do you see now how i make it -> looking CUTE ;:)

yep .. i need to fit it to my char

the meta-rig for human is that on the right:
(or it will doing a bad auto-vertex-weightning)
oh.. need to fix the hand-tips
*LOL
yeah, it needs that "meta"-bones
thats the "meta"-rig (special for riggify-addon now) .. but at end a simple blender->`armature`

*lol \o/

so..fixing armature
yep, may its same as with some of my haxelibs ;:) ... no one really using it out of halfwheat
(plan is to let make face and such by texture later to keep all simple for low-poly/pixel at the end)
oh, for game-char later maybe the ear will be removed from mesh again


so.. i think now its looking good
therefor also the big head

like if a child did first steps (that also looks cute)
wanna try to give them also that special walk
but the cuteness is cos thats  proportions of little child

nono .. therefor the legs are to short
ah
i have to deform the middle a bit higher
😂
its _sooo_ relaxing in doing this

i am still finetuned the mesh for my proto-model again for an hour now *lol
:-)
i am feel like speaking to HAL into an old cubrick odyssey
what if we would ask chatGpt into that thread ? (is clyde then answering to gpt *lol ;:) =?
yeah, its funny
ah, there he is 🙂 ( sieht cool aus! )
(umven maybe is back tomorrow, vacation-time also is over so need to be fit for scool;)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4e6S28_7FU
<@694560611601743893> some day the `letter`-style into peote-text is also able to -> `glow` ( but "step by step" like <@642308650463002626> would say :;)
(that need to get -> `EDIT` <- able )
(to slide some musical-note a little bit up/down while playing)
(wanna also have little random -> modulation into!)
(i am need to integrate into all of my stuff very easy!)
<@694560611601743893> can't wait to see your old haxe-`tracker` -> remastered
... i am will more concentrate on the fun-things into codinglife ;:)
hey half, also if undo/redo-reversengine works here ...
much more large to `scroll`!)
(also inline-documentaion makes your whole code
jo
(and to keep them -> updated!)
good simple samples + many comments is best
-> i am SHIT on DOCUMENTATION <- *lol
(we have to ->connect<-)
half, i am really like that you also concentrate on audio-tool again!
(www-links that never will be die ;:)
anyway, for all others it really needs more links!
but the really good coding freaks also will find that into minutes without
i am think there is need more cross-linking to -> sample-repos <- also
Bulby, Half... what do you are missing into docs on Readme.md ...
or what _would_ you are miss if you would be looking the first time at that lib-git-page entry?
(mypaint*lol :;)
to replace the old "dia"-gramm of -> scenegraph
one time i am will make a new picture at first
no no no
yes.. good music ;:)
-> no one will using your TOOL *ool :;)
(especially if you know that even if you write it totally perfect ...
Or do you also hate it to write documentation *LOL
(before ready to put into haxelib ?)
is that not more important ?
anyway <@694560611601743893>  -> the Readme.md ...
haxe 3.47
or if some one using older versions of haxe or hashlink
-> comes again *LOL :;)
... at now [cos i am let it in if sometimes the same hashlink- 🐛
(and while _debugging_ i am also endet into that comment ...
so you get some errors
and hashlink was realative new
was into your first peote-view using for a game-jam
you pointed me to that at that time
do you remember it ?
was only old hashlink bug
sure
( <@694560611601743893> for older haxe/hl-version the _comment_ needs to remove only ;:)
```haxe

apropos, there i am using own `dynamic linked lists` implementation 🙂
<@215582414544699393> also SO MANY now is -> undocumented <- there while putting new features in more and more ... 🥹
and into Readme should be more weblinks to the samples-repos
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/tree/master/doc>
https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/doc/PeoteView.png?raw=true
i am should at least make this here updated:
😭
But i am really don't know what i am should write into Readme.md there
(for avoiding macrogeneration after the first creation!)
by the way .. did last time (cos of that "CustomDisplay"-prj) also testing something again to let generate the "Element"s there into source-file
<@694560611601743893> pls help me writing documentation also for peote-view so i am can put into haxelib
ahh... there its its _sources_ it was looking for ... interesting
<@1053015370115588147> do you also know the "peote" haxelib for 2d opengl rendering into pure haxelime ? Pls tell me about!
<@1053015370115588147> do you also know the "peote" haxelib for 2d opengl rendering into pure haxelime ? Pls tell me about!
yeah, gpt lifes behind the moon sometimes ;:)
<@1053015370115588147> do you also know the "peote" haxelib for 2d opengl rendering into pure haxelime ? Pls tell me about!
<@1053015370115588147> Do you know some useful haxelibs for fast 2d opengl graphics ?
or for some other code where it needs to run on many platforms (and have to look the same!) ... its really flexible and fast little ui without of so much dependencies like other haxe-frameworks!
<@215582414544699393> maybe my haxe-libs can help you also sometimes if you get messed up into java-swing or something ~~
my hope is that <@694560611601743893> can help me there or into sound-lib also (^_^)
Bulby, only need help into that `syntax-highlightning` later .. thats more complicate then to not "block" the typeflow-input-by-keyboard
is enought there for a non-dynamic Buffer size
also the creation by something like a simple c `malloc`
if the "vector" is set to `null` into haxe its better eliminated
(code only would gets larger and also not sure into GC on natives)
no
*looks happy
my undo-ringbuffer
Bubly, do you see that "prevItem" there ?
```haxe
@:enum abstract UndoAction(Int) from Int to Int
{
    public static inline var INSERT = 0;
    public static inline var DELETE = 1;
}

@:structInit
class UndoItem 
{
    public var action:UndoAction;
    public var fromLine:Int;
    public var toLine:Int;
    public var fromPos:Int;
    public var toPos:Int;
    public var chars:String;
}
```
this is the helpers:
```haxe
class UndoBuffer
{
    var buffer:Vector<UndoItem>;
    
    var prevItem:UndoItem;
    
    var start(default, null):Int = 0;

    var end  (default, null):Int = 0;

    }
    
    inline function nextPos() {
        if (++pos >= buffer.length) pos = 0;
        if (pos == start) 
            if (++start >= buffer.length) start = 0; 
    }
    
    inline function prevPos() {
        if (--pos < 0) pos = buffer.length - 1;
    }
    
    
    public inline function undo():UndoItem {
        
        if (pos == start) return null; // no more undo
        
        prevPos();
        return buffer.get(pos);
    }
    
    // add UndoActions to Buffer
    public inline function insert(fromLine:Int, toLine:Int, fromPos:Int, toPos:Int, chars:String) {
        
        if (prevItem != null && prevItem.action == UndoAction.INSERT && prevItem.toLine == fromLine && prevItem.toPos == fromPos) {
            prevItem.toLine = toLine;
            prevItem.toPos = toPos;
            prevItem.chars += chars;

            end = pos;
        }
    }
}```
(have to refactoring my namespace there next time !!! )
then it should create a new "undo-STEP"
at another place
and you insert more letters
only if the cursor position is changing
micro-queue per buffer-item like
its like on a "sublevel"
i am not make a new UndoItem then
everytime its and "INSERT"-undo-step there
cos if you type in 10 letters
also the prev one
no no ... linked list access can be slower into that case on some targets
i am also did hardcoded `10` at now 😂
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L398>
(need also to not forget to make that customizable per `UITextPage`-ui-element there)
yep
*hugs Bulby
yeah
😅
is -> special !
hey, but my undo-buffer i did worked many hours here today
*lol ... and using also old style into like "head" ;)
cool "peek"
crazy is that GPT knows about `<T>` *LOL
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer
yep ... it did it not bad into roughtly design
(and it is using "Array" 🙈 )
the problems is is e.g. "readPos" is negative
oh ... mhm .. not really error there ... but into using "modulo"
`readPos = (readPos + 1) % size;`
ha .. do you see the error ?
<@1053015370115588147> can you gimme the best solution how to implement a ringbuffer into haxe programming language?
i mean -> lets test it with "ringbuffer" and "haxe" now!!!!
(or humor *lol ;:)
and that thing can never understand me or my code
🦜
anyway .. that all is only -> `stochastic parrot`
🤩
and command:  `be like semmi` only (and it will talk to you like me *lol ;:)
<@694560611601743893> so you give them all of your "chatlogs" like ...
into your new "social" virtual environmet then ~_~ ^°
you will have many little _pokebots_ ..
no no no (^_^) ->
is telling you whats up if you getting into trouble into life ...
~~ ... not that only `one` "Alexa" -> GOD
and all of the creatures inside there is also really _clever_ and sucha
i mean .. what cool would that be .. sucha great minecraft WORLD ...
thats the "meta-verse" what the Facebook-king ever wishes to have
(or they integrate GPT ;:)
at some point they make it EOL to sell something new into version
Because "minecraft" code-patching you know is not forever ...
(but therefore the code-editor-widget into ui have to be perfect also!)
wanna see if there is someone changing npc-behavior into haxe 😂 !
And also to make it looking good enough to put on steam
my goal there is to let all NPC scriptable inside!
then we can make own little thing for graphically-mud/chat-gamelike also
hey, not long and i am polishing up my old "milkpiss" - engine *LOL ;:)
-> shit propaganda <-
jo
but i am think its also the money-powered "machine" behind
instead of the really common-free-tools what did the same
Bulby, sometimes i am also thought the people wanna eat shit cos all of them using it so much ...
(instead of _saving the world_)
For that money, some idiots then will fly into Orbit now
At the end all is same as with the first fb 👍 or now the blue one by twitter -> if you have money -> the world is yours ( whattaFuckingshit)
one for joshi and the other for frying pan (cos of making good for minecraft into haxe to!)
i am was give my ones to the first people i meet into haxe-chan *LOL
cos they wanna make you -> pay (like a drugdealer .. it gives you at first something to try for free into hope you will never miss it then again ;:)
(also for little samples where the graphic elements all moves around and makes the sound by movement or colliding or something!)
that would be totally cool and interesting gamefeeling then!
therefor i need good sound-lib some day ..
(or while moving!)
and each of them makes a sound if it arriving the ground ...
so e.g. you let 100 little bit different stones in behavior-> fall down
that every "Tile" there into "Physics" can have different speed also ...
the cool there is ...
Hey half, if the mess is over with UI here .. i am will make old "milkpiss"-engine ready again ...
Like a big `orcestra` !
-> NOWA: 256 !!! 😂 )
( 4 on c64 -> 4-8 .. also splitted into 16/32 on AMIGA ....
🙂
simmultan
256 tracks
it have to be play ->
yeah
and that songs can easy edited at game->RUNTIME
yep, good is that the pure "music-track-data" is very compressed!
(all into sound also into our "modern times")
yep.. that needs streaming bufferdata also nowadays (much more complex to 🙈 )
ahhh ... understanding
ah ok,, cos before it only using the pure SID-CHIP ?
is there not something lost into simplification ?
mhm, but why it is converting the mod-format (what is more like midi i mean) into an wav ?
coool
oh, you already used it into pure c sometimes ?
ah ok
(or need is simple sample into C for testing ?)
can the others into channel help you into ?
into haxe then Bytes io tools to read it short by short
and same as into C: `malloc()`
oh, you need -> Bytes <- then on haxe-side!
into haxe its also an Int then at the end
oh, Int16
\o/
do you get the protrackerformat-lib ready by Ammer for simple testing  ?
anyway, into haxe nowadays its an cross-Integer 32 Bit *lol (and unicode!)
also into `C` .. its allways "chars" (one byte!)
(its an old _perl_ thing with me ;:)
"charPosition"
yep, sometimes into FrontProgramm (the peote-text lib) i am also using
i am have: startLine, endLine, startPosition, endPosition
jup
-> recoloring the letters !
and trisitter should gimme back at what places i am have to
so i am put that into a trisitter-"query" like this
```js
tree.edit({
  startIndex: 0,
  oldEndIndex: 3,
  newEndIndex: 5,
  startPosition: {row: 0, column: 0},
  oldEndPosition: {row: 0, column: 3},
  newEndPosition: {row: 0, column: 5},
});
```
cos there it looks simmiliar:
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-tree-sitter>
🪢 ⚓ the -> trisitter lib later!
also i am think at the same "place" into code-mess i can
🌅
YEAH
sometimes it creates no new undo-step and only updates the last-step
(apropo "step" .. i should also name somethings better "step" instead of "item" there!)
Have to put inside also a `lever` what makes it all the times creating a new undo-Step
but best help is into -> testing <- later if its finished
if you wanna you can also put the one for putting the "delete"-actions inside UndoBuffer now (its all simmiliar now)
\o/
yeah, its best!
maybe still some bug into "ringbuffer" ? ... do you see some yet ?
so the ranges is "start" <- "pos" - > "end"
if pos is at start -> no more to undo
but if "pos" grows and is same as "start" ... it makes "start" also grow up,
so the oldest "undo-step" gets -> override
And for "redo" i am only have to grow up the "pos" index up to the "end" value
so seems its most optimized now into performance.
( no push/pop or shift/unshift overhead like into using an Array datastructure i mean )
sure
-- it creates a "meta"-rig for you *lol
with that addon (but if you know where you can easy ship around and forget all about the complexiness behind into "blender-armatures"+IK)
its more easy but also you have still some glitches
cos using also the "riggify"-addon workflow there nowadays ..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ14vidzSs4
into blender i am have todo like this:
yeah... simple tools is need for minecraft
inverse kinematik is not easy into blender to (without some tools) .. i am did that the last time manually there 20 years ago (its named "armature" and IK-resolvers and there is much more new stuff nowadays)
ah, cool
(also faster than the electron-vscode-stuff!)
and maybe 50 times faster into reaction than the OpenFL/Flixel things into.
but all is 10 times faster that the text-editor-things from haxe-ui (e.g. what Ian sometimes showed me what he did into Kha there)
Bulby, the day that UI-stuff is finished i am will only touch for bugfixing or to migrate to newer haxelime 😂
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L1370>
e.g. i forgot that if i am use "delete" for font-renderer the "toLine" parameter have to be one line afterwards: ( so "+ 1" )
easy to trap into bugs
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L1439>
e.g. look at here where is using inside of UITextPage:
normally yes --- > problem is if the code around allways to much complex
So it should "rotate" if reaching the end ~~
here is my `ringbuffer`-implementation start: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/util/UndoBuffer.hx>
did also get the first undo-ing to work here ( for for inserting some letters into followow and pressing ctrl-z then to delete again it still works)
( if i am get some further into undobuffer here, i am will also continue with my gamechar + riggify into blender tonight! )
ah yes, umven also told me it needs that tool
(in blender!)
for IK you can easy using riggify-addon also!
wow,
(Umven still told me he also wanna try to create some next days ... he needs to figure out at first how to make a texture for or something)
ah cool
(rust iam also fully trust .. into that :;)
yeah -> 💯
hey, but all ui i am know (out of [n]curses) is also running -> super SLOW
(also not complete yet but not long and all the base is have all features it needs to only build the common widgets)
no no ... i am have my own crosstarget little haxelime one now!
java-swing also is a huge-one ;:)
uch .. react is really -> HUGE ;:)
hi Bulby!
later than we can make peote-ui code-editor ready for an separate trisitter-ammer-thing!
jo.. pls
hey, i will make trisitter then only for javascript (quick and dirty without externs)
<https://aurel300.github.io/ammer/target.html>
mhm... with node.js only
or only for native dynamic-linked-libs ?
is ammer also can handle js-externs ?
ah, that will be cool to support all platforms
aahh.. the protracker-thing .. i am remember \o/
oh, whats the "microdmod " ?
Do you successfully did get the "ammer" to run ? ... maybe that would be good sample for
.. and only if all is working there at first i can make it ready for syntax-highlightning
my plan is to use the code-edit-widget and an log-text-output at first for _deeper-testing_ that -> "queries" there ...
(before i am do a "dirty" implementation better would be extra little lib!)
Also maybe need some js-help into -> trisitter-web haxe-`extends`
but at first -> undobuffer (without that feature the text-input is useless)
-> if its summer i am wanna lay at the beach and play with GLSL shadercode there :-)
but cool would be to use also the "code-edit"-stuff there sometimes later
(also some is not 100% implemented for touch and multiple UIDisplays eventbubbling)
have also no usecase ... but peote-ui sometimes need extra-work for i am sure
me also
re ... <@694560611601743893> do you already tested for android also ?
see you later!
anyway .. need to buy something for lunch
(oh, i am hope not!)
😂
YEP -> the PERL - WAY \o/
i am like regexp .. but maybe not much is using it
("re" stands for -> "regular expression" 🤣 )
*lol
apropos ... do you know what pcre is ;:) =?
jupp
or more blender-rigging ;:)
better only undobuffer for me
(until that i am even not will try here building for android ;)
hope they will fix that android-hxcpp latest bug also
yep (but also much good tooling and optimization!)
into cache or somewhere after first build
so maybe lime had old path somewhere
thats cos lime sometimes look into haxelib folder also!
anyway ... i am try to allways using one version here (don't wanna get the mess totally complete ;:)*lol
there it works with many versions
yeah -> don't do it (only with the common haxe-version-manager or via lix!)
aahh....
(so can only test new 4.3 on win7 here)
on linux i will keep 4.15 here
that could be into wrong path or something
ah, yes
(on linux ?)
hope its only that
(or maybe some "haxelib dev"-trunks point to wrong directory?)
or your haxe-installation ?
(but it seems compiler-error)
also neko ?
and asking into opengl-chat ... maybe a known problem
( by lime create ... )
mhm ... then best trying the lime -> hello world sample
(lime rebuild _something ?)
yeah, that can be ... do you was using a develop-version or from haxelib ?
oh, so nothing todo with peote-net ?

mhm, wonder why only into peote-net
and all the same as into peote-samples ?
all errors also point to lime
mhm... don't know what that could be
mhm, maybe something with your IDE ?
(maybe some old hashlink-build-fragments)
-> make clear 😂 ?
oooh
mhm, have haxe 4.3 also only on windows here so can not test on linux
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/ba86b3772294b1d3caac047ea1a7d9ce083877a9>
(there was a commit last time!)
or maybe not the latest trunk from peote-samples-repo
also builds
is maybe something not latest into peote-net libs ?
mhm, here its building .. client`&|`server (also with the new hxcpp!)
(last time i am only build it here with 4.3 there was no error like this ... but maybe i am only build the client and not the server)
mhm, is that only with multipaint ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L1423>
oh, and have also 2 simple "actions" for inserting/removing linefeeds!
so it allways queueing "action"-number, the positions and the "string" of what inserted or deleted (also if more insert/deleting is into following it should only grow up the last action if it is into _continue_-action .. e.g. if you insert 5 letters into follow without moving cursor around)
Was also thought to store the functions but that could make problems later for GC (to much cross-referencing!)
now it only have to implemented (the more fun part!)
yep, that already works *lol
so if pressing "ctrl z" it is fetching the last action and did the _opposite_ one
anyway, <@694560611601743893> .. now i am think all is prepared into using the `undobuffer`😂 -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L1352>
yep
(e.g. the old song: "Way down in the hole" .. any of interpret -_-)
discord sucks, allways if am wanna inline some music-songs from youtube it say: not allowed cos of _rights_ 😭
<@272509832421179392> ||<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ciz_oePjw>||
<@215582414544699393>

end endup (after solving also some riggify-glitches) into a new mesh-model also 😂 :
Its really more easy now to control all (with particle-system before it was painful) .. 
also have still some glitches inside (e.g. if i am using on my mirrored mesh for charactere)
spend also 4h today with blender, new hair-system and geom-nodes but i am think its better to wait for animation there (maybe in some months they will build it in)
so easy to have more fun with and to optimize sometimes per haxetarget
(+ list of targets you want)
so into terminal only have to say: `hxp bench <new sample name>`
(the cool is, if you put a new file into there .. you have it automatically into hxp ...
<https://github.com/maitag/littleBigInt/tree/master/benchmarks>
yep ... i am really needa haxebot -> prime-number-generator-sample also sometimes!
wonder who is the other one there ... was looking into git of last time but there was not much into (Crinfarr)
(not _optimized_ yet)
src:<https://github.com/maitag/littleBigInt>
https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/162395145352904705/1092552479654293535
... so means: also fully macro-compatible!)
( and also runs into Interpretor-mode ... whats totally cool ... never tested that ...
<@215582414544699393> oh ... (was muting haxe-server but see it now) -> furret is using littlebigint-lib
really liked it.
-> totally `chaosfastlysmashed`
most i am liked was what he did at end of some songs.. that UAHHRAEGHH... or something
(nice guyes!)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CflKWvcox7I
"plf"...
(have t-shirt now 💓 ) .... 3 band (fully hardcore)
last time i am was into Marat-pub here there was the band from USA
😆
Bulby, do you also have this into your county ? (maybe like "Bingo" 😂 :)
(ah, deepl know it;)
ah, and what was the strongest _Question_ today ?
third place is good \o/ -> congratulation
ah nice (into mollotov ?)
apropos Bulby, this is my old friend Mudu (from little vilage-town here)
ich weiss (^_^) -> aber nicht überall oder? 🤣
(na ja, OSL+GPU -> problem here *lol .-> anyway -> H A I R \\Ö/
some old OSL-stuff i did into 2016 today and all works (nearly) out of the box
hey, but blender is superfriendly to you over the years ... e.g. i am was loading
(some of them also needs weeks to get fully inside)
don'T use that addons at first
-> every day 2-3 hours doing _meshmodeling_ blender-tutorials .. and into some month you will be modeling-profi there!
into geometry ... for eyeballs they mostly using the UV-one (i am like the cubic-one .. where all faces are `quads`)
meshmodeling into blender i am really like ... there are 3 ways to make a `sphere`-eyeball 🥚 also
at what amout of pixels for your eyeballs it was not looking good anymore ?
e.g. the pupil at eyeball not seen anymore ?
after low-resolutionizing
yes, i know what you mean ... all details get lost into and not seen anymore also
(thats often problems if _styles_ is mixed up)
ah, understand, you mean not good into combination to pixelart ?
(my last hair-tests all the last years also did not really get fruits at now)
something not working ?
what was going on with blender there (cos of _cursed_)
(you can put now `hair` on, that would look crazy 😍 )
ah yeah.. remember your blender-eyes Bulby
e.g. how it looks for a 128x128 char
Needa setup also to see the hair-result for _pixelart_ into realtime
have to try to animate this curves (and on a more circular shape)
you have also `guide`-hairs (where the rest is interpolated from) ...


so the "modifier-stack" is all geom-nodes already \o/ (and by click you can edit that part and do whatever)
The workflow is super now into sync with `geometry nodes system` in blender
or how it looks if the char is diving underwater (so lesser gravity and smooth looping thought some rest-poses with the _hairThere_)
i need -> wind-effect and such
hey HAAALf *hugs
(really motivating me to try again for char-generation for simple 2d-game)
really -> hope there will be _animation_ soon \o/
i am happy to get some _result_ now into trying out the new hair-SPICE...
anyway -> leo + /tr is enough ;:)
oh, interesting (didn't knowed that)
and then only `> leo ...`
ah ... by aptitude -> `libwww-dict-leo-org-perl` )
yep (don't remember how i am was installing that ...
we can use `/tr` also here
hey no problem 🙂 ( on linux i am sometimes using `leo` from terminal also to translate some words )

hair rocks \o/
<@642308650463002626> , hast du schon 3.5 am laufen ?
really frustrating ... i should try out the new `hair` next time (maybe more fun there)
also blender gimme OptX-error after building the _initial_ kernel-cache for OSL/shaders there 😭
but after a long mess of installing new nvidia-driver (the lastest crashed all!)
Was trying out blender 3.5 today cos of new OSL->GPU-computing feature ...
here is vacation this week and Umven on travel (was seen the haxe-npc on computer there yesterday ... cool stuff, it also is attacking 👍 :-)
🌅
https://youtu.be/W_0_ASA2E3A?t=160 *hugs
thank you Bulby for good conversation tonight
me also have to take a little sleep

this ones ->
i am can not tell much about (into my times i am was climbing trees ;:)
p l a t i n
golden, silver one ---  > n o   E  N  D
not like simple _tiling_ anymore
i mean -> pokemon was at some times -> to much for me (into _variation_)
sure
pokemons ...
Bulby for this one i am `created` peote-ui! (to let write into any language how it should `interact` with some one -> who meets ;:) *hugs
nature <- into
any -> this little think

Is is safe to run minecraft-server on dedicated ... i am really would do for Umven and You if not someone that hack my whole hardened linux debian on host by that i mean 🙂
i am went to NY  sometimes and all was told me to better say : `fuck`
sry bulby if i am sometimes say to much "shit"
really wonder how that was possbile to get out of ;)
but that game really get best of it ...
the shit into valheim is -> unity-engine 🙈
(also last time -> zombioid)
do you played that also ?
was -> vallheim
My faforite (non-free) game i am was played really often
(not for _training_ -> only for _processing_ * * -__-=)
cos only 6GB of gpu-ram 😭
my GPU also cant do generate AI->deep-dreaming images yet ....
shit
yeah 💓 (raspi \o/) ... my one also still running -> fractalgeneration ;:)
but how hard is the ... or how high is the `wall` nowadays -> to let run own server to keep `data` (what all is _creating on_)
my little nephew told me today about
(\o/)
what all getting new into ms-minecraft at now
and what is into the new "movable" ships and so on
😭 🌊
like into the `origin`
Not such -> `creative mode` anymore
and it was at first remembering me into the old LEGO-batman-games
was seen sometimes how they played that here on switch together ...
no, by the original developer
do you also know the new game of minecraft creator ? (something with "dungeon" into name?=)
(same as what we have now into that old shooter-game [and i am not mean unreal 1] ;:)
someone really need to rewrite minecraft into haxe i am also think
(into `holy namespace` i mean)
ah, and how was it feel ?
how long do you touched haxe and frameworks before going down to haskel i mean ?
do you only know by own Flixel-code ?
(there is also some older lib called "-origin" where i am was started into haxe-NME-root)
my (re)masterwork int`o´ haxe: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view>
(i did many years optimizing that shit!)
peote-view haxelib
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/Boids.hx>)
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peoids/
and did this:
(only one time -> anyway ;:)
eh Bulby, my old child <@272509832421179392> did sometimes also using my lib
into .-> MASS-BEHAVIOR:...
-> automatically all go into same -> SHITFUCKYDIRECTIONS
yep
yep
CKKKKKKKKKKKKK
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
it was -> F
t0day into haxe-chat or what do you think
S
S
E
MESS
after that
my hero is Dimensionscape at now.
also i am need no I A N-ui anymore
a n y (have my little peote-tool at now for!)
_to implement_ ~ ~
but much harder after 16 ,,, 32 .. and all what cpu/gpu `cache`s
my goal is to create same tools nowadays (into haxe)
(not like later and with "deluxe"-paint)
where every `pixel` was set by hand
that totally remembering me into old c64 times
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/bulby/assets>
i am also totally fan of your pixel-art
Bulby .. are you still there listening ?
AND
(i am also wanna see the _minecraft_ world -> especially the little cute haxelogo one there what you showed to me sometimes into haxechat)
Umven also installed -> chatgpt <- for me here
you can using the old babelfish into ear here
if _communicationprbl_ i mean cos of natural language with Umven (also german [more worst into english than me at now])
we also have `deepl` -> `/tr` here
Any ...
(also into some years i mean ... i am hate it if some tools have new version and old data can not be used anymore -> so `lost` into some of manner)
(to get free->playing and keep own creation-data at local Computer to play sometimes again ;)
so i am invited you Bulby cos Umven have to learn how to hack it
any.. i am think most what gets open your mind into playing/creation is that old minecraft game at nowa....
and i am not like that (also blender-version by steam can break dependencies!)
ah .. no .. we (or umven) only using by -> steam here at now
jre? .. or java-interpretor ?
do you run minecraft also by steam (on linux) ?
(on Umvens Computer)
i can see it also out of only still-image-screens
i mean if you can invite Umven into your minecraft server where the little haxe-logo is _instantiated_ i mean ...
-> sure .. thats ok
fomr debian-stable repo ?
would like to see the haxe-logo inside of minecraft into -> `action`
i am totally paranoia into installing java on my coding-machines here
(Umven also still is _sleeping_ .... _timezone_ you know)
yeah, we all here also really hates this kind of `spy-shit`
no -> `censoring`!
feel free here Bulby
(my `mind` -> `haxe` and _peote_)
i am not the player here -> its <@689869574883246237> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(or into pixelart-creation also ♥️ !)
pls tell my little childs the `secrets of minecraft` hacking (^^) ~
yep -> family *lol
thx
(can also be more _destroyed_ or missused then ;:)
to Display itself (more custom properties also)
On other side the inherit-way can let make also more changes
so maybe also the `callback` is better into performance and don't need to create an extra haxe-file also!
`class CustomDisplay extends Display` only (and a compiler-codition to let enable this cos i am have to remove the `inline` then)
so you have to create own child-class
```haxe
my customRendering = new CustomDisplay(....);
```
for oop you have then something like this into your code:
at first we could copy/paste the code of lime-sample what draws a quad
but we have to write a sample then what e.g. draws some simple triangle and to test that all of the other Displays behind and into front of that custom one is working correctly (also at all targets!)
it both not much effort ....
Cons then is that you allways have to type `display.` to use something from the Display-instance properties (while into oop-way you have all inherited then)
Pro for the `callback` way is that there is no OOP and to use it only need is:
`display.onCustomRender = (display, peoteView) -> { ... custom code here ...}`
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Display.hx#L446>
i am only not sure to make it by a `callback(display, ...)` from there or to let make an own `CustomDisplay` childclass (oop) with overrides
the plan is to let replace this loop here (what calling the render for each Program) by custom gl-rendering ..
<@272509832421179392> magste mal nen `haxe` channel hier machen (ich glaub den extra deepl brauchen wir gar nicht ... `!tr ...` geht ja auch ueberall!)
need to go into supermarket to buy some food ..lets try out that peote-view-hook tonight!
about that "ban" ... oh oh ... i only startet reading and also now they talking about my chat-behavior *LOL
apropos, what was going on into causual-chat since i am was out with the childs 🙈 ....
simple open-gl drawing whatever you want (can be also _hook_ to other pure gl-stuff or engines or whatever)
have to do a sample
"texture"-using still could be a little bit more tricky then cos its using a `statemachine`-thing what is `active` and what not (to not change it all the time if e.g. all programs/shaders sharing the same textures)
a "Display" there can also be set to render into FBO automatically every frame (or by call)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maitag/peote-view/master/doc/PeoteView.png
so it can using the display-sissoring, zoom and offsets also, but not the shader/texture/formula from `Program` (cos that is all also hardcodet for quad and Buffer/Element-generated there!)
only have to `override` down from here then: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Display.hx#L432>
(will try that later after lunch and if more silence here! ... maybe <@694560611601743893> also will joining in and we could use the new text-edit integration)
will do that with a simple triangle within! ..thats the best way to mix it inside without make something unstable ...
at now problem was that a child of that class can not override inline functions but i will do a simple compiler-condition at now for .... so needs only a sample then where i am make childclass e.g. `CustomDisplay extends Display` ...
<@371312079526952960> have still a plan how normal glsl can be hooked into peote-view -> `Display` ...
it works stable but to extend it for multi-shapes (also ngons) it needs to long: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Element.hx>
The only thing i could implement faster would be into let inject pure glsl-code inside of the render-tree/queue
to implement tris in the good way would end in a total rewrite of the `Element.hx` - huge macrocode there + `Buffer.hx and Program.hx` ... if i would starting that it would need to much effort and time (maybe a year or more) ... and i am happy that all run stable at now how it is (would had to be into design-phase at the last _rewrite_ from peote-view-origin to nowa-state)
i think for syntax-hl later i should start by trying out this one: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-tree-sitter>
\o/
puh, with the _resizers_ now it goes on: http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/CodeEditor/
but i am wonder if it would be possible to implement this _aperiodic_ patterns also _procedural_ by fragmentshader
still working on implementing "resizers" into peote-ui to let UIAreas easy set this up on all sizes/edges,
ah yeah ... its an "einStein" :)
yeah, the _aperiodic_ patterns is interesting stuff ( i am like that penrose ones <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aperiodic_sets_of_tiles> )
(will start new sample for _code-editor_ now .... need to implement that `undobuffer`!)
*lol
(rostock is maybe to small village .. here its rare into sucha labs/spaces)
Be happy that there is something into your town!
had also a strange discussion about blender and cinema last time into the pub ... my old friend there is not liking blender also cos it have a so long _learningcurve_ 😂 ...
Warn lustiger Abend mit Silvana 👯
<@642308650463002626> hab letztens im cro übrigens auch Tilo mal wiedergetroffen 😂 (was der mir alles vertellt hat .. auch mit Erik und so *lol :;)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozOj_Fy0qZM
So you should also make a little haxe-meeting into the UK (like what was the plan sometimes i am remember into)
only homeworking also is super inefficiently
The developers there have to meet into reality (then also all goes 90% faster into developing)
haxatons for the kids
but at the end to make haxe better it is need more yearly haxe-meetings again
What i am like is the weekly voice-chats about haxe.io there!
communication is allways like throught eye of needle
(you feel comfortable and happy with all your virtual friends but if you would know them into real world most you would not like so much maybe ... or maybe others you have no good communication into chat you would love into reality :;)
Its often also -> illusion <-
chata have more a "virtual" social component!
its more make sence to write into github-issues at nowadays or into the forum
i mean ... for programming and computer science ...
yep, and also -> Disco-CHAT ;:) [for me!]
🛒
🙂
(what explaining into detail ...
the good videotutorials also is hard to find nowa.
most of some stupid -> INFLUENCER-freaks
But whats the most high-rated video-blogs there ?
they wrote Readmes ... now they make -> video-tutorials (what for graphical software like blender i am also like and can understand)
Also its still a new age for computer-coders ... into the past
its the beginning of a new age into -> making that tech to big money now (same at where the WWW was started to go -> commercial <- ... it was only need some years and internet was full of shit)
and since GPT->mass-influencing, 
there is also a new "gold rush" starting ;)
"big data"!
-> ai-trainingdata to monetarize
also "discord" is no -> free software !
thats what i am think about.
maybe 30% -> autobots
also 95% -> `lurker`s
its a swamp!
or a -< "game portal"
Sometimes i am think its more a -> "influencer like thing" at now sometimes 😂
Since the fnf-kids there its not the same anymore (what is ok also ... the ones will find its own place then whithout all the deflection around)
normally ... as what i am know of programmers-chats .. for me its normally that there is more who helping and try to improve also the language
jo -> thats _stupid_ !
sure, but most asking only its questions there sometimes
All the ones there who only wanna support for their own projects (or work!) should pay it't own personal trainers and not waisting the time of all the free and open-source developers
sure, but its haxe -> `chat` and not a free `help`-support for anyone who asking ONLY the same questions again and again (i am not the one who don't like to help others!)
I also complained once when he scolded about Sinta/Roma (that they hang around in his park). But don'T think you can see sucha _left/rightwing_ by `brainscan` *lol
(mhm, ob es auch genauso denkt was die Pofitmaximierung von Microsoft angeht 😂 ?)

i am hope you will win a prize for... totally awesome
yeah
really good (also the start with the earth and all)
(at second level it really goes on 🤩 )
wow .. supercool ... also the music and effects
(kanns kaum _erwarten_ 😅 )
for what do you was using into game ?
(the firsts who did it there named it plasma)
`PLASMA`
no no .. the `c64` one was called:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/811292278382395452/1007661046128979968/lava-flow.mp4
the procedural shader you was showing me last time (lava ..magma.. )
apropos... i am `remembered` how is was `called` into c64 time ...
🌅
12h only left 🙀 -> stay on ! ! !
wow
<@694560611601743893> how was last game-jam, is it ended at now ?
i am think microsoft never can stop that people doing their own stuff and own servers also into future
maybe minecraft is much better ... there is millions of modders and coders and "hidden"-forks maybe also (all easy java also)
(so since that time i am only wan't to build with my own or open-source software .. to not lost my _creations_ anymore .)
And also all players there was left cos of "World of Warcraft" first MMO at that time :(
(no mysql-bindings anymore)
yeah.. but at the end ... bioware was not make sourcecode open ... and nwn2 was made by a shitty company and new engine where server only runs on windows
(and much of coding to make things like sailing onto an ocean and stuff like mirror-mazes and own quests-stuff)
(at at that time i am was creating own neverWinterNight-game own world on maitag-server ... +mysql bindings to make all persistent and to let also change stuff from inside the gameserver)
they created this one into also: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lner_Dom
it was into ~2001 or so ... a fully town .. + historically buildings into full details
and great detailed world .. was totally fascinated
Into the past old friend of me was showing me his server sometimes .. and he and his sister was creating a so much
.. thats also why i am not play anymore cos don'T trusting them (if there would be no own server for my own creationbuildings -> no fun <- [maybe later i can not load it anymore or build on])
<@694560611601743893> i am wonder what microsoft did there now to put its `paywall` into game...
<@689869574883246237> still playing minecraft ?
awesome ❣️
oh . .for all later keypresses ?
into its `Events` somewhere (but forgot where)
Lime also have that helper as i am remember
ah .. ok (then maybe an haxe-conditional to en/disable that globaly for html5)
but if its only some "special" keys may its better into performance to call that manually (but a helper-function is definitively need than to not make code dirty inside user-spacecase)
yeah.. or also another "option" (simmiliar to `up:true`) inside of the `ActionMap` config
if that works maybe only a helper-function would be enough then inside of input2action to call that (and #if html5 ... around)
maybe `untyped __js__('event.preventDefault();');` is enough inside the `Action`-Function for that special keys only ?
<https://github.com/maitag/input2action/blob/main/src/input2action/Input2Action.hx#L165>
oh.. have this also on todo-list for input2action
aah... awesome
<@694560611601743893> gameplay gets better and better
yeah.. the second car was rotating after crashing \o/
(i've improved also the rain-shadercode a little bit <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/819ec1814fedfc2144fbd245089214af25c3e636#diff-0dd68f8afc1269d77b9cf7115da6a737e10d7fd8cb56f461d045e3b60abc08fd>
may we can use it later there sometimes or into other project 🙂 )
hey cool \o/ .. the car is turning now!
Cool would be also to give it an angle (by uniform)..
so the faster the car is driving the more the rain should come from front!
(and for the sample i did zoomed also to double-size)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/rain/src>
needs only now to make _isometric_ + z-index (to let the drops go behind the car also)
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/rain/

Still finished also the tile-anim for a single raindrop what spashed at the ground:
yeah, @anim is very flexible ( but also complicate and hard to remember ;)
so time and values can be decoupled 🙂
by: `elem.timeA(peoteView.time, 2.0); // from actual time and during 2 seconds`
(by "A" identifier into this case)
e.g. if you change color AND position or something ... it will be sharing the same "time"-start/end values then!
so you can give MANY properties the same time by like: `@time("A")`
`@posX @set("PosSize") //@time("Position") @anim("Position") //@constStart(0) //@constEnd(100)`
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/Animation.hx#L20>
oh.. there is even more you can _tweek_ ... look like here:
ah (thx;:)
(i am allways forget it is: elem.xTimeStart or elem.xStartTime ... not sure at now ;:)
and simmiliar the start/end time for.
you allway can allways change: elem.xStart and elem.xEnd (whithout identifiers)
e.g. you make `x` position -> @anim()
But the common way is by only `@anim()` (and 4 properties will be generated + 2 functions also to change them at once .. one for the time- and other vor the Start/End values to that time!)
Another way would be also to use the time-uniform directly (like into shaking-shader)
perfect!
cos i am "pack" all @customs therefor into multiple `vec` (some for the "short"-integers and others for the "float"-types [cos some GPUs have limit of amount of varyings!])
This all is for fragmentshader-access (varyings)
(it is replacing "alpha" with the real glsl-variable-name)
`@custom("alpha") @varying` makes "alpha" the identifier to use inside of program.colorFormula
look at the generated shadercode also ... there you will see what it is into glsl at the end
🫂
(yes, this is only generated if not using @const... )
ah.. cool
so if start end end-value is 1.0 .. it should be allways ON
.alphaStart ... not sure ;:)
(by autocomplete!)
you should have also the real "Start"-Value
this is only the speed!
no, not the both time values (timeAStart and timeAEnd)
really.. YEAH \o/
there is "Col" the identifier inside @anim("Col", "constant|repeat|pingpong")
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/simple/src/Main.hx#L65>
The ElementMacro generates also a function for you to animate!
Or you control all start/end directly like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/simple/src/Main.hx>
If you wanna enable/disable blinking manually you do have to do without @constStart(0.0) and set this also for the elem.AStart = 0.0 (to enable) or 1.0 (to disable)
(and this is multiplicated to the original alpha-value of the texture allways)
so into 3 seconds the "alpha" varying will be from 0.0 to 1.0 and pingpong back and forward again
`peoteView.start();`
And after all:
`@custom("alpha") @varying @constStart(0.0) @constEnd(1.0) @anim("A", "pingpong") public var alpha:Float;`
so:
"A" is identifier what you can set into @anim also (if you hav multipe anims):
`elem.timeAStart = 0.0; elem.timeADuration = 3.0;` to control the speed
ah.. dont forget to give the element this before adding to Buffer:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/ShaderInjection.hx#L153>
good samples (but without texture) is here:
`@custom("alpha") @varying @constStart(0.0) @constEnd(1.0) @anim("pingpong") public var alpha:Float;`
can be that you also need to set the name .. i forgot, so inside Element it should look like:
`program.setColorFormula( vec4(base.r, base.g, base.b, base.a * alpha ) )`;
+
`program.setTexture(texture, "base"`)
ah .. yes
but can be that you need to set also alphaTimeStart and -End for that Element also
normally for `@const` it is set directly into shader ... but if it is an `@anim()` it needs 2 values
<@694560611601743893> or is it without texture ?
if "BASE" is the identifier for the texture what you are adding to the Program also!
(no shader-injection is need but you have to set the time maybe ... i can do a sample also if you wanna)
"vec4(BASE.r, BASE.g, BASE.b, BASE.a * alpha)"
Into ColorFormula then:
and then using this into ".colorFormula" of the program .
sry, get a little nap ... to animate like that you can use a @color or easyer is a
`@custom @constStart(0.0) @constEnd(1.0) @anim("pingpong") var alpha:Float`
( <@689869574883246237> grüß mal alle von mir! )
need a break now (maybe i make it -> splash <- later .. and separate peote-sample to spawn many of them) .. seeYa and good progress!

i did still also painted something (maybe can do little sample later for rain-wheather-effect)
is it into debian repo ?
easyer to adjust the position maybe
can it be on an extra layer into scratch ? (extra ebene die darüber liegt beim zeichnen)
hi
OH.. and the counters + symbols at top \o/ .. perfect !
waterpuddles also looks good and makes more interessant for gameplay!
<@694560611601743893>, <@781745960829059072> your code looks good !
ahh.. i see now... there is level and scenemanager
👍
cool, now also "replay" is integrated!
WORKS
moment
ok
is the libs also needs to update ?
ok, will test latest
(cool .. also scales with the size!)
ah... now it works (sorry)
moment
oh.. maybe cos from the git shell

ah
what is `zip dist.zip -r bin/html5/bin` for ?

<@781745960829059072> sorry what i am was wrote yesterday..  was not much constructive or helpful (to late at night 😅).
Can take a look at the codebase today!
yeah, you are right
😂
*lol
Into a game you can do things what you never could do into reality
i mean .. if the buggy goes on the beautiful beach into game its no problem
yeah, thats good (to get them "lost" .. what the theme is)
also now we have both graphics, so the buggy could go "offroad" later into level
holes into the road is a good idea to make more challenge
hey, its only a `game` 😂

<@642308650463002626> Wie kannst Du dem Drang wiederstehen mir auch hier mal ein selfie von Dir zu senden (cp!) 😂
i mean: is `this` the `way` to `enjoy` the 🌅 ?
( <@694560611601743893> i am asking me reall why you wanna make a "car"-game? ? ? ??? ??  ß ??? ? ?)
-> zusammenzubringen <-
`Autos` und Strand
<@272509832421179392> ich frag mich grad wie <@694560611601743893> auf die `Idee` kam
~ ~ ~~~
what the shit ... that i am can not join into pub now where you are
ahh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2iEP-GwAlA
OH.. what is figure 2 ?
hey, greet all your friends there from me!
*lol
greatful
<@694560611601743893> still diving into code ?
`back`
<@689869574883246237> very good work! 🫂
ok... wish you good progress (i am will be back into 1-2h)
(<https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716902714/fullscreen/>)
thats cool into scratch .. allways like "life"-painting

Will go to Wolfgang now for a beer ... pls show me how it looks inside the game later!
*exited
absolute (also crazy that music .. especially the first song!)
very good artists
woah..my heart was stopped for a moment as he was climbing on top of stools on table up on balcony here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxtaw8Y9n5Y
WOAH ... YEAH \o/
(and the seats have to be shown .. very discrete)
Someone have to sit inside then later!
ah yeah..sorry
Cool is the stuff on the hood (motorhaube) also!
color is top!
the roof later should be red or something what good gets into harmony with
*LOL (oh, and now: strong rain is starting!)
oh, and now the first thunder-sound is rolling here
hey .. "handstand" same word into engl. and german 🙂 ?
one will do also handstand on table (i am hope will be save!)
more performance
..all is hoping thats not raining and stormy
will put the video link into here (starts into 1h )...
there is only Artists ... 🤹
roger
(my room here is a backstage since last 3h ;:)
Half, can you put the proto on github also later ?
🧑‍🏭
(we are back into 1h)
<@689869574883246237> lets go ?
we need some fresh air now to get new power (really hot here also in and outside)
let me look at the code (after we are back from outside) ..
awesome
if it is still into -> perfect \o/
you are brave Half 😅 !
OH
(lieber alles einfach halten ... es ist ja nur eine Woche Zeit [it is only a week of time we have!])
(better also without echo-physics!)
better to keep it simple i mean (game have to make FUN .. any of graphics!)
but better not ,... cos of the cam-angle
mhm.. little rotation can be made by peote-view
<@689869574883246237> are you get some ideas?
nice

so more like that style:
ahaa
AH... so only scrolling into one side..
(for inspiration i mean)
<https://www.google.com/search?q=pixelgrafik+beach+top+down&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjjwJTNkpT5AhU9IcUKHdN-Bp0Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=pixelgrafik+beach+top+down&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CXBFiVDmCIEGgAcAB4AIABXogBzgaSAQIxMJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=i5reYqPPBr3ClAbT_ZnoCQ&bih=855&biw=1379&client=firefox-b-d>
some templates how it should look from top-down-view
Or what is still created at now (to hook on!)
(wir müssen jetzt nochmal kurz raus und frische Luft schnappen)
I am think we have to go outside a little bit now for an hour ( frisby into the park like what we boring doing all the time 😅 !) ... can you give us pls some presets so Umven can start after we are back ?
for the _BUGGY_ i am think the _Wheels_ need to get little animation also!
yeah, this for example is also more then 32 into height
32x32 pixelsize is best i am think!
lets -> START ;:)
any.. we have 2 days now
(vieleicht nur abens für eins zwei Stunden)
maybe in the evening only for an hour
(Umven, kannste auch grafiken machen wenn Du bei Oma bist .. an Ihrem Laptop?)
*LOL
hey... that we can still using =?
(if handpainted)
oh.. no no ... 32x32 would be better for jam i am think
(to _commit_ for me would best on github)
where is the prototyp hosted ?
pixels is best (fastest way!)
\o/
Half, i am already quite curious about code of prototype, do you also using echo-engine to let the buggy bump against some environment (beach chairs, parasols..) and the chasers?
thX 🫂
<@694560611601743893> was everything working with peote?
Dann genieß die Natur! Diese Woche ist ne haxe-jam (und heut auch wieder Balkon-session)
Ah ein Rentier ( hat es geschmeckt ? ;)
grüß Dich ( bei den Elchen ? 😂 )
tomorrow Umven have time also to look for drawing and i can test the code
woah..perfect 👍
super
ah, sounds good
is it from top/down view?

Warum läuft es jetzt eigentlich etwas langsamer als vorher, rechnet er noch mehr in den neuen rules ?
(hab noch bischn codecleaning gemacht eben, also wenn du noch was dran machst, check bitte vorher einmal aus)
Funzt gut und mit dem Vec2 sieht alles besser aus!

ich warte schon mehr als einen Tag auf dein

ist das ok so ?

usw)
(um leicht eine flache baumhierarchie zum KLETTERn
ne ne .. das werden dann alles -> sub-folder
wie soll ich es nennen ?
und lad es auf maitag hoch
ich builde gleich das sample
aber die ist -> COOL
(natürlich nicht an deinen heiligen formeln der boid-distance-ai(
na .. aber ich hab auch schon am sample rumgemoddet
(wenn ichs gleich builde fuer htmlshit und weiterposte)=
<@!272509832421179392> was soll ich als "quelle" angeben ?
(nach 1h -> sammeln die "boids" sich da *lol.. totalcool)

OK ...
echo-boids sample also going on:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/echo/boids/src/Main.hx#L99>
Yeah .. that was MYSELF*lol
cos of "04:47" ip-change-time
(maybe it was really me .)
but it created a painting-server also
`encountered read error 113: No route to host` is only if some client disconnected abnormally i am think
Its like a _honeypot_ now 😂
`whois ... `
yeah .. from telefonica-germany
Or was that me *lol
oh ... some days before someone starting the "multipaint" peote-net-client and trying to enter (but no peote-net-"server" there what opened that _channel_)

```
(but tell me also .. from time to time i will look at the logfile there)
you can also using it at any time you wanna play with peote-net!
(even into many instances .. i mean into "channel"-name)
its startes into zero-time :;)
and if we wanna have to paint something together
the perl-server is still running .)
i mean
(and also much refactoring ... that would be to much effort!)
but i am really let is as it is at now (it would need 1 or 2 weeks to complete!)
yeah .. best last time was the "multipaint"-FUN
(until not much others is using ... i am have also some "unfinished code" also there ... anyway ... from time to time it also need a new quick demo to play around)
i am do into the "peote-samples" folder at now
use-and-forget
(but hard to extend later or to build up on .)
js into webbrowser -> quick and dirty
(so i tryed to make it all more _dynamically_ but not so much efficiently like it is working at now)
because there i am was did code more javascript-for-job also
into peote-view origin i am was also much quicker into all
yeah
Into peote-text there will be also better shapes someday! (via that new shaderspice ... but need my time for also)
totally awesome (did'nt seen that yet)
there is keyboard-input now .. what is changing
(the second sample i didnt seen yet ... craaazy\o/)
i like you readme ... after that words -> samples directly!
"A grid and a game loop, what more do you want..." \o/
How did you wanna do into Tyke-Engine? ... that looks really good growing up all the time also 🌅
really need that to have a good usecase to play around with all peote-libs together now!
But the old boulderdash-engine i am will rewrite from the scratch this year !!!
*lol
🙂
the more we know (and can be collected to fix sometimes!)
Anyway ... the more samples there are ..
one wrong _step_ .. .and it explodes (hard to find some bugs then .)
like -> nitro glycerin <-
yo ... for others (and even for me from time to time) its
🫂 🌞
totally
i would do it better .)
into peote-view 3 (totally rewrite)
there is the haxe"break"
but "Buffer" <Element>
Program -> bufferinterface
most glitch there is that Buffer depends on Element-type .)
is depend to usecase.
To store the peote.Buffer reference or more
so only an additional integer .)
peote-Element allways have only storing its opengl-buffer-index
But not good for mass of sprite-SPAWn there to store the "buffer"-reference allways inside of
but instead of OpenFL or other Frameworks my Sprites is more customizable for OpenGL-way
like that old idea of "Sprite" (c64.)
into peote-samples i try to diff into 1) main.hx and 2) opengl-stuff per Element
jo
( propagandalf told me last day that he was using peote-view/samples because there its all into 1 file!)
is "near" together
if the parts that is handling special parts of logic
important i am think is
between
switch
yeah ... but problem also same if you have 10 files to
(not to commit any line .. but if something makes me happy that it is _running_!)
me trying all the time to work into sync
i mean ... how it is changed
yeah ... but you can also show into one!
(k;:)
you have to put into haxe-chat also!!!
\o/
WOWOWOW
apropos ...
absolutely (some times i will look or ask how he did that)
(thats definitively the better way to connect them to physics-engine)
yeah ... have to rewrite all a little bit there at now
will TRY now:)
(sry..littlebit fuzzy tonight)
`body.sprite` access ?
what is the first `sprite` identifier for ?
ah... ok (the haxe package path)
mhm ... 'sprite','tyke.Sprites.Sprite'
(i cant believe because of "macro in macro"-glitch or something)
TOTALLY AWESOME
i mean because of Element.hx killamacro 🥷
jo
wow.. and this works ?
or how i can do this for the sample ?
please 💓
(is tyke at gitlab ?)
Oh.. \o/ cool ... can you show me the part
Did you tryed it also into Tyke-Engine ?
but maybe conflict to peote-view element-macro
point 2. looks good
ahhh.. yeah, i am remember also now (last time into echo was also much of years ago for me at now)
what is dynamic and can be connected to a body ?
"userdata"
is echo have something like
(the red and blue instance refs? )
But how to get the peote-view one ?
red.body, blue.body
At now we get the physic bodies only
but one thing is missing into starter for boids-distance-check
only start this shellscript
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/generateAPIdoc.sh>
dox was working from the beginning there!
🤣
yeah .. how much DEEP it is - > penetrated
*lol ...
(so on top to not make it slower if not need the rotation-contact-change)
ah..i remember Austin told me also he wanna do make that later with good performance
how much they overlap ... i mean if that is
... can we have there automatically the distance ..
"overlap"
cool is also
AH .. COOL
ahhh... the point at where they collided ?
but what is "c" ?
a and b is the both bodies
Halfwheat, to you know what the enter: (a, b, c) params is ... i am think
and if 2 is colliding ... they should change its colors
Best i will make the circles now only painting the outline (for debug-paint-mode)
the echo-physic features to let them "fly" arround by changing only acceleration into a direction (that by own "boid"-simmulation-code now!)
So the "intersection"-test works ... but cool would be to use also
setting both "mass: 1" and no more "world gravity_y" anymore!

this works now:
Mhm.... if i am set both mass to zero ... the collosion-events did NOT fire anymore
(i should try to move the red sphere by mouse now!)
mass 0 only make them not affected by gravity
no no ...
Allways if they start intersecting -> onEnter event ... (and onExit if they are leaving)
```hx
world.listen(red.body, blue.body, { separate: false,
...
``` did it really as expected ... perfect
😃
HA... WORKS
now lets playing with the parameters to check only boids , where its sphere-radius-bodies is into colliding-state ;)
yeah (i am allways happy that this works \o/)
(if we need sometimes a circle-shape :)
```hx
class Circle implements Element
{
    @posX @set("Position") public var x:Float = 0.0;
    @posY @set("Position") public var y:Float = 0.0;
    
    @custom public var radius:Float = 50.0;
    
    // size calculation by radius
    @sizeX @const @formula("radius * 2.0") var w:Float;
    @sizeY @const @formula("radius * 2.0") var h:Float;
    
    // pivot calculation by radius
    @pivotX @const @formula("radius") var px:Float;
    @pivotY @const @formula("radius") var py:Float;
    
    // color (RGBA)
    @color public var color:Color = 0x000000ff;
    
    var DEFAULT_COLOR_FORMULA = "color*circle()";
    var OPTIONS = { alpha:true };

    public static var fShader =
    '
        float circle()
        {
            float x = (vTexCoord.x-0.5)*2.0;
            float y = (vTexCoord.y-0.5)*2.0;
            float c;
            
            if ( sqrt(x*x + y*y) < 1.0 ) {
                c = 1.0;
            }
            else {
                c = 0.0;
            }
            return c;
        }
    ';
...
```
(now also the Element looks better)
but first i commit the working code ;)
(puh ... allways trapping into the glitches ;)
now will look for intersection-tests
they collide \o/ again

ARG... stupid ... SURE
isnt working
but radius: 100
will try this
reall an "radius" is need (thx)...
CIRCLE-shape is the problem
AH

mhm... but same problem
```hx
@pivotX @const @formula("x/2.0") var px:Float;
@pivotY @const @formula("y/2.0") var py:Float;
```
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/echo/boids/src/Circle.hx#L20>
AHHH... i am an idiot ... look here was the problem before i commented it out *lol
ah ok.. will try this again
its also if i am using rect shapes
the only i am really removed was the pivot-denterpositionizing
```hx
        var red = new Circle(buffer, Color.RED, world,
            {
                //mass: 4,
                x: 10,
                y: 10,
                material: {
                    elasticity: 0.5

```
that i am also thought
but both are the same (100x100)
into the old sample it was working (but there also was rotation what not is need at now)
(the red now collides at the bottom of the blue one ... what did i am wrong?)

but why the hell they did not "collide" at the correct place:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/echo/boids>
ok, did created new sample here:
anyway... need to make lunch now .. see ya later!
(there we could use our old "line"-shader to draw many of them into little _fans_ around the lightsources and using this as "stencil"-mask while drawing the lightmap)
or also the line-intersection test for using to create a _shadow map_ for 2d-lightning
cool are also the "new" echosamples ... e.g. for softbody-simulation ...
(after lunch)
will test that later with some spheres!
apropos, wollt mal nen neuen Translator ausprobieren aber das online Teil kann gar kein Deutsch *lol <https://www.apertium.org/>
kaputt ;) ?
that was changed inside of echo i mean)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/ab5ec8b6af52b083762b63108572e640ce1adad8>
<@!272509832421179392> did the "echo" sample into peote-samples working now at your computer ? (i did tested only on windows last time and here only is some warning cos auf new body-options ...
so the "sphere"-size should be the maximal distance until the _gravity_ between the objects is to great to get an effect (so the echo - SAT-optimization works then into background)
i am think this will get more performance instead of checking each boids distance to all other available boids ...
And all only via _sphere_-shapes around the "boids"
yeah... it should only change direction and speed manually inside of "enter" and "stay" all the time!
Cos for simple boid-simulation they should not really "collide" (changing direction then automatically i mean)
```hx
world.listen(a, b, {
    separate: false
...
```
ahh... separate to `false`then ?
ah cool .. where is that into documentation/api (i've shortly looked into samples ony and not really found yet)
yeah, but echo have integrated SAT-optimization already ... so would be cool to try out there also
I've looked already but can't find out how to make e.g. some circle shapes what only detects if they are_intersected_ but not let them _collide_ by the default physics (it should only act like a "near"-sensor and using our custom boid-code to change speed, direction and rotation!)
cool for the "boids" would be to use echo-engine-optimization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VgLkk_drx4
Dann könnte man die boid-sim immer nur zwischen diesen objekten checken... aber das lieber später mal .)
muss mal schaun wie man es bei echo macht das man die Kollisionen ausschaltet, aber immernoch checkt wenn sich 2 zu nahe kommen (wenn man dort nur sphere-shapes hat)
<@!272509832421179392> mhm, das echo-sample funktioniert bei mir ... hab aber noch was angepasst bei den BodyOtions (dort ist das neues in der echo lib)

sure
better into peote-view i would like to see it there
no no
(into -> texture -> section)
we should integrate this into peote-view core i am think!

and i am need windows 10 to use blender 3.0 😢  ...
Mudu, i mean even the old BGE is not inside of nowadays blender anymore ..
to make a good 2d-game (and ruleset for).
what good fit to peote-view also
wanna have something -> unique
what not look like into pixel-artstyle like what ALL is doing EVERYWHERE
into shortest time
to make much of charactere-animations
so the most hard i am think is to find a way
idea now -> really (all libs are mostly ready to get into -> USAGE)

first more haxe (i need to refactor milkp.)

eh Bulby... nice to meet you here <:blobcattongue:1217267686854361178>
inside]
so i am wanna make it that into the next step .. it will remember (to not iterate that ones again) -> IF THAT IS POSSIBLE *LOL ;:) [not sure there is still a
but some not match at the first iteration, cos the are above or below ...
you check all the next into h-position
So if you move some `element` horizontally
(e.g. vector or array.. can be targetoptimized later)
My idea is to keep them sorted all of them 2 times allways into lists
(also a "map" is faster now instead of a own knotted balanced tree)
and with vector/arrays instead of linked octree
(and its spatial split method)
yeah, wanna find something what is faster then using echo
( so to optimize it have to remember near neighbors to sides ... like that way i mean ! .)
wanna sort them specially .. and then that they sort themselfs everytime one is change size or position
yes, only for non rotated ones
you can use also SD at now
WOW
remembers me into b52 (not only the band i mean ... .also there is a blender - challenge every week over the year!)

<@694560611601743893> after seen your one with `sperical` hit-testing for your space invadors demo
Still thinking again at now how can be best into make a little "collusion-detection" for rectangular nonrotated shapes only
e.g.: <https://www.openfl.org/learn/npm/api/pages/lime/graphics/Image.html>
i am looked inside Limes API today and there is also not so much documented
yeah, there is also some DOX glitches (e.g. links for marked types in index.html point 2 folders upwards and such ... maybe if all is ready i am will edit index.html manually or by shellscript)
(cos i am also still fixed some small things)
will also upload all that .. so would be good to test that all samples are building
can you pls look if there is english-mistakes ...
yeah, not long and all is complete
(oh, also Mask .)
and the header for Color
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/>
textureformat is also inside:
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/TextureDataImpl.html>
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/TextureData.html>
Did completed also `TextureData` now so it can convert each format into another one now (also integer into float and vice versa) .... also huge of new into API 🙂
To create new `levels` for my friends.
Also on C64 i am more liked that games what had a integrated level `editor` included.
but there i am also not only `played` i mean!
(as i am was older)
(only c64 and amiga)
never had sucha toy
(pls 4me only -> `COMPUTER`!)
any `gameconsole` i am HATE
no, cos you can not edit the gamecode!

(whattaBOORINGfuckshit)
eh, last theme there also only was -> PLAYSTATION -_-
np
(needa script someday!)
(doing that all by commandline here)
(fucking github.. i am know how shit it is .. to allways check out the branch...)
`playground`
at now ? (after the beers i mean)
do you can concentrate to put inside ?
(lets show them how the _really_ `teamwork` is!)
i mean
supergeil for -> playground <- MERGE
now the code looks totally -> MINIMALISTIC <-
(i ve seen that already i mean!)
i am really like that (also remember you worked on that before!)
then let me post your video
🍻
( to "deflect" from what they wanna -> inject into our minds!)
there at now .)
game->proto
anyway.. do you think we should present your new
therefor i did that video (also cos of -> `LURKING` .)
... u know .. especially if it is with gipsy-into-park .. or banning my old coder friends like <@371312079526952960>
some dickheads only -> i am can't really keep my mouth closed then ...
*LOL
my dick is -> `normal` to me .)

my dick or what ,) ?
nah ok.. will _believing_ you (and not leave that chatchanThen)

he told: "better ban him on more then lesser channels...." 🙈

Half, or think into how much fun we had with
is the best
much of little samples
for my little graphics framework -> you are helped me at muchest (also <@231149223855390721> into the past!)
🤣 )
USE USE USE
only
(i mean also into optimization or WHATEVER -> no single word ...
but with that -> high-rated ones -> not much into last 7 years
into peote-libs and also input2action
e.g. i am get so much feedback by you ...
(also it is not fully target-performanceoptimized.. i am hope that no one try to make that withouth work together with me into that)
i am wrote it only to try my own secure-password-async-transmission sometimes
*LOL
( or maybe 3 .)
if littleBigInt is downloaded 121 .. i am think that at least 5 using it permanent at now into somewhere
no no (only if no good lib is avail!)
ah.. yeah 😂
(but littleBigInt is more than formula at now \o/ ;)
only `4` users ... what a _shame_ ~^

-> used by no one 😢
ALSO
that `input2action` (really simple pure haxelib)
do you know also ....
OH
(not wanna risk a apt dist upgrade)
(have to reinstall that sometimes ... cos it still runs on another hardware at now *lol ;:)
anyway, i am have debian on my old computer at now ... -> superfast
(faster also and was feel more open at the time i am tested both)
(was better then virtualbox)
qemu is good (last time i tryed vm-stuff)
good
do you also using windows on new computer ?
google and all -> bigdatacollectors!
(so no one see what spywareshit is inside of code)
sometimes i am think they did it only for obfusciating
anyway, how much sound-sources can be handled by e.g. limes howler lib ?
(cos that they also using llvm and that to complicate and intransparent googoe->wasm)
-> crosstarget haxepower!
also is not have that
RUST
eh, i am think this is why
🙈
yeah... web-audio lets or not -> ALL SHIT since EVER
FUUUUUUCK
Do you know about grigs-audio .. is there was more commits into his lib ?
(e.g. all have to calculate to the game-players distance into soundvolume)
into amplitude-formula
for the spherical-detection
and then same as with the `radius`
samples + modulation (@formula;:)
samples also would be ok (and non-gpu-mixing i mean)
anyway, it not also have to be fully synthetic
(where we get `stuck` into html5-wasm-shit 🙈 )
i am really sorry that iam did not get it running the last time into programmingsessions
let keep it into our minds ... the "peote"-audiosynth also!
yeah .. also NO ONE have THIS .)
(e.g. the color of an element is changed over time -> also the sound-formula what comes from them into the whole MIX is `modulating IN` automatically)
`synthesizer` at the same time!
to make sucha supersimple game what is also a
but the old idea what not get out of my mind is
sure -> later
do you know what i mean ?
https://discord.com/channels/804476992400392304/1091778536152510624/1231014211468136560
)
from left to right (or if openAL is ON -> also from down to top into direction)
(you also have to hear how the bullet is flying over the screen.. e.g. some
SHOT a BULLET
And if you press the button and
that each of them also make sound (like `random pulsating` one or something)
Think on your little game .....
or lets start with 50 (a great choir of mixed sound i mean ... same as fast as into _rendering_)
what makes sound!
e.g. -> 1000 elements
and peote-audio .)
hey
yes, this is really need
but that have to be better `wrapped` for a peote-irc client
i mean you can also connect to irc by simple telnet
i can make it ready if you want ,,, but you have to connect to irc protocol (over telnet)
did that 9 years ago with the origin peote-view (before i am started the "remaster")
also it not using peote-text at now
(have to migrate it to newest version)
problem only -> peote-view 1
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-telnet>
so IRC is `integrated`!
but eh.. there is already a telnet-client .. and ready for mud games also
(have a prototyp in perl only .)
(only for web you need a proxy then!)
peote-socket have -> `telnet` ... so no problem!
no no .. also like a 2d-game ... with speech-bubbles!
(all same sized -> into a grid -> m a z e )
(with no animated ... but 1000 little char-avatar-images .)
but sometimes i am think to also only make a chat-program
(all together with uv- and normal-mapping)
i will start make a game again (need more blender -> ENV tests before!)
eh, but into haxe-NB-chat .. i am think they not need our 2d-framework
you are the `poweruser` 🥷
eh, i am only did it for you ( at least 50% the last 2 years! )
sure ... but to keep also `clean` structure here into chat-hiddenplace .)
will ask <@689869574883246237> tomorrow
(also the "deepl" one)
maybe we should put all into `ml-tools`
... why we have `chatgpt` and `chatgpt-2`)
(it is really to much into my opinion .. even here i am ask me sometimes...
(maybe he have to _refactor_ also at first all his "channels" there 😂 !)
(only was a bit un-sure cos he did something last time into my old `random`-channel there into chatchumber)
yeah, i am also hope
i mean peote-view also could run (thx to haxe) with little changes directly inside of pure webgl
eh, and also never worry about `lime` ....
<:blobcheer:1217265725169991731> <:blobok:1217270621482782750> 🌅
(but also had no idea how to make that tile-frame-animations)
maybe only with `TileMaps` there
(out of that some stuff really would not easy into performance to realize by the common ones)
now think you had to do same in openfl or flixel 😂
crazy
(we should ask chat-gpt here 😂 )
to not iterate throught all spheres each time.
ALGOrithm
Apropos, for collosion-detection .. there have to be also a superfast
All is really haptic now since this year!
of the texturedata-abstract
so an auto-casting
`var texture:Texture = (limeImage:TextureData);`
to make:
oh, have to put also something into TextureData
ha ha ... brave
(in some days i am put `1.01` into haxelib repo also!)
sure ... into git at now also the latest fixes are inside
ah yes... maybe all the other downloads was by Nanji <:blobhugging:1217266170047103018>
maybe 3 others now also was testing it
there are also 8 downloads now on haxelib
yeah, better lets USE it now ... and only some docs left
(but really -> later .. and only if really need! ... at now the cool is that you can also put direct GLSL code inside the formula-string)
(so you get that value -> calculated back!)
some day .. with "formula" lib .. i can also autogenerate the "getter" by macro
thank you *blushs
<:bugsnaxsmile:1217254545244028939>
😂
some day i am also will really implement formula lib also there ..
yep... on the first sight only its a bit hard to dive in ... but then -> full power (everything is possible :;)
yeah .. by a simple formula -> all into `one line` \o/
i am not sure that will work with the macro i mean (never tested)
```haxe
@custom var tile_height(default, set): Float;
inline function set_tile_height(f:Float) return tile_height = height/f;
```
ca nyou pls try
for performance would be better to make a setter maybe ... to not calculate on gpu...
(but i am also never tryed get/set in Element 😂 )
`@custom @formula("height / tile_height") var tile_height: Float;`
crazy that also this works
aahh.. the red one is for mask-IN
`s p i c e`
h u g e ELEMENT 👍
nice.. you did also make it DOX-Style :)
ah ... really wanna see !
awesome
ah.. so all circles into collosion ?
<:blobcatopenmouth:1217267311153647656>
How you make the collosions.. echo ?
YEAH... really good
(wow .. also into the shoot-bullets!!!)
i see also `maze` into eye of the char ... supercoool
`aMAZING´
how cool it THAT \o/ <:blobstarstruck:1217270847299911731>
oh WOW
this is the `real` "Walker-Benchmark" now

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/walker-on-rails/src>
now the Walker is perfect .)
it will `flip` automatically .)
so you allways set a `positive` size ,,, and in depend of how it moves ...
`AUTOMATIC`! (by little position -> anim xStart and End calculation)
oh, i am think the -> `mirror fake by negative width` have to be also
i am think the next goal is to make INTERPOLATION from `walk` to `run`

the `tiles` also is animates into  `sync` to the `position` NOW...

<@694560611601743893> new sample was born: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walker-on-speed/src/Walker.hx>
have to write inline documentation therefor also 😂
anyway... can also be at every time by Color.RGBA() also
Can all also make with an implementation-class ... but then it really is not DCE `optimized` anymore
(or to put a little bit "red" inside .)
Color.BLUE6.setAlpha(200) or something
i can not write
but ... e.g. if i am wanna put alpha then ...
(BLUE1 -> 10% darkblue ... up tp 90%)
e.g. will also have more colors .. like BLUE1..9
into `chain` notation ....
i am also little bit pissed cos that i am can not really use the Color-Abstract
lets better have some samplefun again .)
ok.. i am think  for `Program` i will continue another day with inline-doc
into my old samples
but also get "warnings" there of -> deprecated things
(some days more to dive inside ,,, and also np to use it together with peote i mean)
what matters -> `echo` is also good for now!
.. so also circular and elyptical ... out of rectangle-shapes i mean (and all into "integer" or "float" <T> variations)
for sucha Collosion-Detector-Tool ... and maybe 2 kind of shapes (or 2 different ones)
e.g. some `Interface` what only have same as Element into `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` ....
(did started that some times but was get stuck into best of optimization [for rectangle-shapes only also for sure])
Cool also would be a simple helper to have some simple `hit-test` without to use the `echo` lib
anyway.. i am so happy that all is so flexible still at now into that
would make it flexible into other way of "render-FBO-chain"
at first `1.01` -> fully inline documented!
best all this into peote-view `1.1` then!
What also cool new feature there would be to use a `Texture` as a Display-`Background` (at now it only still renders a colored quad or nothing if its full-transparency for the background `color` value)
(better i put some extra inside sometimes later .. where multiple Displays can be rendered all together into one texture ....or still the whole "view" [better!] and then make all what not have to render only "invisible")
oh, not sure this will work crosstarget
Oh, and <@689869574883246237> was asking me for `audio` today ~_~
Apropos, what missed also it to render the whole peote-view inside a texture ... e.g. to make a screenshot of a fully composed game .... but that maybe only later some day if we really need (normally by framebufferchain there is still some texture only where all is rendered inside fullycomposed for more professional games with post-effects and all)
i am think for the simple sample ... i am rember also to change something that it only using greyscale-png
anyway, its also not so much important .)
(so each foot allways have to stay on ground and no "slide")
allways wanna do sample where it shows how to make the tile-changing into sync to position-change-speed
yes, its not the `renderspeed`
(we should enable FPS into that kind of performance-stuff also everytime)
wonder why last time someone say what the walkvariation-sample is laggy
(the top-ten 😂 ;)
(or also list of linked screenshots for only the best `demos` :)
we need also a "test them out" link for the playground-repo-Readme
\o/
also all sounds good into english-language?
puh :)
(maybe you are also find something what you not used yet 😅 )
yep, its better for others out of us then to use that lib
So i am think now its also OK there: http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/Display.html
(will look later ... have to cook now)
Mhm... into this samples: http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/lightning/simple-multilights/ ... i am not sure at now that the middle of the light what you move by mouse is also at mouseposition
*lol ... but nothing is really _seen_ into ECS 😂 http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/ecs/aidans/
and http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/pixelimage/pi_xy_limeTest/
cool that his also builds: http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/
( have Display also doxed now ... it goes on .)
awesome
ok, also fixed now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commits/master/>
hey, have to go also to the baker ....have much fun in the pub
wow
I must have overlooked it when checking the others... well, there are quite a lot of them already ;)
really long now 😂
*lol
nono .. will also test out the sound samples again (did long time not build them)
will fix them later ... many thanks
\o/ thats awesome ... will put a link into readme there
yeah.. i am really like that painting-style (to my little story byside)
<:bugsnaxsmile:1217254545244028939>
looks what someones did there with my chatlog ~^:
We can put your video link directly there also later!
(so some ones can test out samples ... and also pre-released API -> link .)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view?tab=readme-ov-file#samples>
ok, Readme also better now:
or with logos new _toy_ site .. i don't know ..
nothing better todo 😂 ???)
(also what they are doing by `capturing` chatlogs there ... is some have _really_
*lol
anyway .... not my problem .)
(yes, or someone told him to ban me from `main`!)
🤣
eh, and i am still banned from the main-channel to write there 🤐 ... how stupid
(but not really helped me!)
(the only one who was _first_ there into macro-chan after my question was NB ~_^)
*LOL
i've asked for `macro`-solution today, but i am think nobody knows
(anyway .... lets wait on haxe 5 for that!)
(shit that this with abstract and method-chaining not really works 🙈)
also the `Color` is near to featurecomplete: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/Color.html>
(better `overview` now about all the _meth_ at once)
I am really happy with DOX there at now
ah .. yeah ... that would be cool !
🍻
thank you ♥️
yep (hope for Display the next time i am will be faster now)
(somewhere i forgot params .. and also some little fixes now!)
puh -> <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html>
ok, i am think i am `ready` for today with `PeoteView`->Doxing ....
(moment, still polishing 😂 )
oh, for the "render" function the parameter is missing ... will fix that
supercool ... later we can also link some samples inside!
ok, now its perfect <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html>
crazyshit..that also works into vscodium
ha .. works into dox ... moment ... will upload all to see
oh what .. that also works in Discord :-)?
oh, moment.. will try out to link to lime-api
oh.. its done automatically by using that code-markup
is that like markdown-syntax ?
apropos, how can i am put a   `web link` inside there (e.g. to link to the `Display` site from there?)
`It renders a list of Display areas and the entire view can be moved and zoomed.`
then lets do it like this:
mhm
would this be also ok ?
mhm... but this is important feature ... maybe then more shorter as before and:
`It renders a visible list of Display areas (or hidden FramebufferDisplays). The entire view can be moved and zoomed.`
no no ... its better if someone look into the code to understand what is does
this explains more ... what do you think *hugs
```
PeoteView represents the main "view" that must be called in a Lime application at startup. It is connected to the application window to handle and initialize the gl-context and its `onRender` and `onResize` events. It renders a visible list of `Display` areas and can also handle hidden `FramebufferDisplay`s to build an FBO ("render to textures") chain. The entire view can be moved and zoomed.```
ok ... now i am think more near :
mhmhmmmmmm ..... *my brain smokes now
i am at his now:
mhm.. this is also good ....
moment ..... the second sentence ....
how about:
```
PeoteView represents the main "view" what have to hook to a Lime's Application Window on start.
It contains a list of `Display`-areas and can be shifted and zoomed.```
yeah.. no hurry ... i am happy to start that
maybe something also with "main"-thing ... so the user know that is only have to create once per "lime-window" (so in 99% only need to do one time)
( if that is ready -> 🍻 .... still sitting some hours here to clean up only the "view" at now 😂 )
can you please give me the good english words for 😅
hooked to the "lime application window and events"
mhm.... the "window" is not really "setup" ... its more
what do you think ? -> <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html>
yeah ... very good now
everyone who is using it for the first time should be best informed by 2-3 sentenses only
```
    PeoteView is where the window is set up and initial GL context initialised.
    It represents the main-"view" where all Display-areas is rendered inside and can be shifted and zoomed.
```
how about this:
oh, yes.. that sounds good
but better not let confuse there
Halfwheat was saying: " ...."
eh, really ... i can insert something:
not really (that have to be for `Element` 😂 )
*LOL
that "Main view to render" have to be better explained 😅 ... no idea at now.
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html
(moment, can upload)
`class` itself.
at now all fields into `PeoteView` is documented ... but not sure what i am should give the
yee.. no hurry ... still here sitting and write the `DOX` stuff 😂  .....
anyway, this should work now <@371312079526952960> : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/bbca09dbec25fcddfed3cb6107424f2df3832b3e>
is to make also font->SHADER (where all is already inside a shadercode so can be used like "system font" without need to load something anymore)
What i can do afterwards (it that works better as now by ttfcompiler and extra fontgenerator for tiled ones)
the problem is then with html and also async loading the texture-coords for packed-ones
wan't to have it only to make it more easy to create that png atlases and the corresponding .dat and .json (and packed OR tiled)
Still started also `peote-fontgenerator` today 🙂
anyway, will fix that into program today <@371312079526952960> ! ( not like into your pull request, only at place of imports i am think it is need)
yeah, can't believe
mhm, maybe this is only still buggy in `5`... 
to have multiple types into one .hx file is one of the features why i am like haxe
mhm, the only difference to Display is that inside of Program it still imports peote.view.PeoteGL (what is not nessessary anymore) ... will try to remove only that line <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Program.hx#L6>,
maybe still works then for you branch <@371312079526952960>
(i am really like to have "PeoteGL." everywhere into front there because i can better see and migrate then ... also e.g. sometimes for heaps or other gl-frameworks what using SDL)
why should it break it ?
Or is it cos of "Version" ... a new keyword or something ?
yeah, can not believe that they will change that ... maybe only a bug in developement-haxeversion
put it on my local todo here so i am will not forget (maybe i am split also the .hx file then or find another solution .. if that really is no bug in haxe5 or where it appears on your environment)
(up to 4.3.4 all is working)
thank you Nanjizael, but i am think i will do this by myself if i am have newer haxe-version here to test out
is it "module resolution" maybe : <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/wiki/Breaking-changes-in-Haxe-5.0.0> ?
( i like that "PeoteGL.Version" etc. there, so i am better see at what places it using my gl-wrapper )
mhm, wonder why there is error in newer haxe version (is it now allowed there to have multiple types inside one .hx?) ... e.g. using that everywhere, e.g. also here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Display.hx#L26>

this was _starter:

i am stopped then my nightlysession with this one:
really interesting if you asking it for "haxe" ;:) i mean


😂
`funXe`
https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/502857487888809985/1225324254317514772
my best last time was this ones:
YEAH *
\o/
you can create the MEGA -> OPENER
hey, into next game-jam
but first let using it for games and peote-view .)
(not long and i am will train it with mass of PURE-math-fractalformulas-ONLY :;)
SURE
(maybe there is much faces into instagram where the scrapperscripts get from)
and faces
sometimes iam think -> 70% beautiful looking girls
or sometimes also -> `fantasy` 😂
they mostly use for manga and photos ?
hey, but do you also think that most of the documentation and all there
(also that reverse-way i mean i am really fascinated by)
(or i am also look at first what SD is _thinking_ what the prompts IS of that ones .)
and it really make it understandable for all
with some keywords
e.g. i am put them into SD
what all my old fractal images now -> makes sense
what i am like into is
*lol -> absolute
after an hour .. you find it!
but thats ok ... you click and click .. finetune .. go a step back and forward
anyway... if i am render 100 SD images ... often only 1 or 2 i am really like (also if browsing all next day)
(or to find good presets to make it simmiliar by little collage or some other hard work of designing-process)
(what before allways was time-intensive to create)
or some cool _splashscreen_ inside
and static level-graphics-data
Or also for backgrounds
avatar-pictures (like for a RPG-game)
best usecase for gamecreation i am think is to create that little
yep
(and "stable" *lol ;:)
(blender is much more easy for me .)
(with SD and all there i am feel like absolute beginner)
anyway -> step by step
Also another thing is that `controlnet`
for our 5-7 frames simple walkcycles
cos with that i am think we could `train` it
tell me if you had time for ...
Do you tryed out `LORA` also
(for `walk`-action)
i am think for simple gamestyle also 5 or 7 frames would be enough
-> "walkcycle-with-SD-variations" then \o/
what we could used for our "future" peote-view games or demos .)
This you know would be the holy grail into make automatic massive game-graphic
there i am was give it up last time

-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/walkcycle/assets>
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/anim-walkcycle/
more variatons of this:
hey, but maybe you find solution to let generate
yeah... playing around is also my goal \o/
what is your plan .)?
for what do you using it ?
coool
How long is it need for one 512x512 ?
Did you tryed also -> image to image ?
much to explore .)
anyway, i am still only will play with that what is `working` here at now
as i am remember -> 1.5. also was 20-30% faster
you also have _refiner_ addon into 1.5
it is really not much different to XL + its new _refiner_
jo
(resolution is really important!)
ah ok .. so the 512x512 one
did you tryed also XL ?
(i am still only at the _surface_ there into materia .)
yeah.. also much to read to dive deeper
aah.. ok.. the "forge" branch of ... interesting
or what is it for you now?
apropos, what do you installed now into SD ... also the simple webui
(press `tab` after selecting the main-nodegroup)
(to simmulate a loop)
(there i am was need to copy some node-groups many times)
(look into last blend file i am send to you)
jo
(will reduce my mandelbulbs->geom-nodes)
into geom-nodes .. .will try out that soon
oh, and it also have a "repeater"s
Also they improved ffmpeg-en/decoding
(really much better as kdenlife or cinlerra or something nowadays it seems .)
8 to 15 times faster now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmIbMx_RM6k&t=576
<https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-1/>
(much optimized there into audio-processing!)
apropos.. i am installed blender 4.1. now
and into final step -> speak the audiopart
for cut out all down to 10 minutes
and then try out blenders video-editor!
(without sound at first)
with your new hardware now you can easy capture all what you doing .. also over an hour maybe
yeah .. that would be cool ( e.g. how to easy load SVG and via pi_xy then displaying by peote-view)
One separate then for Animation ( classic and by @anim for e.g. particle-animation )
(and later ones for special techniques ... e.g. with shader-injection)
and then an extra one only for Textures and TextureData
or maybe 1-4 into one 10 minute videotutorial
...
5) Textures
4) put into a Program
3) set up a Element-SPRITELIKE and a Buffer<Element>to store many of them
2) how to make some `Display` and what is for
1) installation and cloing samples and where to start
then you can do .. best into little 5-10 minute parts
e.g. <https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/>
sure, why not (do you have screencapture program installed ?)
You should make a `video-tutorial` howto about!
oh.. WOW ... never heard about that yet
(and also to use completely different shader-template)
OH... apropos... that is also on my TODO here ... to put the shadercode into a String of Element
wonder where you using `is_ready` variable ~^
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/shaders/sdf-box-gradient/src/Main.hx#L43>
How long it was need for you last time with the sdf boxes one ?
e.g. by converting glsl-code from glsl-sandbox or shadertoy
i am think we are faster also to put it into Elem-code by hand
but as long we are only using it
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/shaders/procedural/src/ElectroBolt.hx>
good to start is here: fully procedural i mean
what generates then all of "Element" for you ...
What cool now also would be a shader-editor
for greater applications i am also think some ones wanna make it better by own
And have also to improve that `TextureCache` sometimes (but i am think you never used it yet)
what cool now only would be some FBO-chain .. (can be also into sample at first outside of)
yeah, i am really need no other graphicsframework for 2d now anymore!

but nothing what is really important
jo, my internal TODO here for peote-view is long ...
need to create fontgenerator (by msdf tool) and a full-refactor of peote-text for
<@694560611601743893> now only 5 peote-libs are left 😂
<@689869574883246237> if you using it next time:
1) `haxelib remove peote-view` (to uninstall the git-version)
2) `haxelib install peote-view` (to install now from haxelib-repo)
and from time to time only: `haxelib update` for new versions!
(i am allways removing that ones before put something into haxelib)
OH, but the `.git`-folder of peote-view also is 8 MB
( all that hard work over all the years for only 60K destilat at the end 😆 )
install-time: 1 second *lol
So the zipped haxelibcode is only 60 KB 😂
(the zip ... and most maybe is the 95KB of the included png image there *lol)
the complete lib is also only 174 KB
put also a git - > `tag` <- now .. so you can also check out by that more easy (e.g. to compare or something if there is newer version-tags)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/releases/tag/1.0.0>
💕
that lib also was only going further so much cos of your great help and using all over the last years
CHEERS half
ah a radler-grapefruit .. cool
yes.. now all will be better into using
me will open also a beer now
🍻
yes, no idea why it was run before and now not anymore
anyway, peote-view also was need many years to find its place inside of haxelib-repo now .)
best if sometimes only need `haxelib install pi_xy` and same with iterMagic, justPath and so on
<haxelib name="pi_xy" />
<haxelib name="iterMagic" />
anyway, the code is fixed at now
pi_xy: [git]
shit
maybe after a haxelib update
"pi_xy/git/src/pi_xy/draw/DrawShapeHelper.hx:5: characters 8-28 : Type not found : justPath.SvgLinePath"
OH.. while testing now -> getting errors of justPath
will revert it to my local version here... moment
ok, np
yea
oh, maybe a mistake then (only mean to put in the "new" sample ... not to change the "_starter" one .. anyway.. if it is the same as into your new one i am will revert _starter-code cos have to fix that "setPixel" .... ARGh... no no ... setPixel is the method from pi_xy and not peote-view ones *lol .... anyway)
(into _starter i am think it only should draw a simple rectangle ... to keep it simple there i mean)
Have to change "setPixel" also now ... but was not sure about changes there 😅
i mean ... is it the same now into _starter as into your new "pi_xyLimeTest" ?
(not mean the pi_xyLimeTest)
```haxe
    public function startSample(window:Window)
    {    

        // create a new Pixelimage by pi_xy lib: https://github.com/nanjizal/pi_xy
        // var image = new Pixelimage(512, 512, ImageType.BYTES_INT);
        var image = new Pixelimage(512, 512);

        
        // draw something inside
        for (y in 0...128) {
            for (x in 0...256) {
                image.setPixel(x, y, 0xffFFFF00); // ARGB ?
                // image.setPixel(x, y, Color.YELLOW);
            }    
        }
        

        // create new peote-view texture
        var texture = new Texture(512, 512);

        // put pi_xy image into peote-view texture
        texture.setData(image);
        
...
```
yes, i mean into "_starter" i am have here only a simple test one:
maybe by mistake ?
yep
(while did the other sample into folder there)
maybe you add something there by accitent ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/b47a81e6d100de5eb63477c1f55b9455293c8eee>
😂 as i am looked inside at now .. i am remember to only draw an yello rectangle
<@694560611601743893> did you added the more extended samplecode also into "_starter" here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/pixelimage/_starter/src/Main.hx#L63> ?
thank you ;)
\o/
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/peote-view/>
anyway, will put it in now
or do you see some bad english into Readme ?
(^_^)
last chance *lol
or something what need to improve into namespace somewhere =
ok, will upload then (need a coffey first .)
i am think also the last 2 or 3 lime versions should work
into haxelib-docs it means: "exact" version ... so better then without (until lime not make a great breaking change)
mhm, can there also be a minimum-version defined ?
Do you think its ok now to upload into haxelib 🙂 ?
i am put something into Readme now for new TextureData -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view>
woah, SD is running :)?
(at "disco";)
most songs i am listen i am also dance to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IoIw8a7_a4
(but there it also often _Crashed_ at that time)
("filmic" colorspace ... that is really need for 3d-postprocessing into lightning!)
(also -> floatprecision and i am have all the blender "renderlayers" then inside of Krita!)
(so i am mostly used krita to preprocess my blender-generated openEXR data into the past often)
what cool in krita was that it had OpenEXR _before_ gimp ;:)
but best into all for me is my old blendertool .) [no gtk also -> B E S T ;:]
i am only remember that it also was crashing sometimes for me here (while gimp is so old and superstable nowa .. never ANY problem into that)
Krita is really better than Photoshop
(e.g. into mypaint there was not so much git commits anymore the last years)
depends on the coders and how long they are able to keep overview of its c o d e there .)
(for blender definitively! .. was seen that last time)
also for gimp
i am sure there also exists addons for using AI (but open source and on your own computer!)
(better for short tasks like crop something out or simple color-curve-chaingings)
gimp is more strict and also stable .)
krita more like photoshop
(but also expensive .. i am only remember how much per month alone for some adobe-shit nowdays)
nowadays with that AAA-software you can really use AI inside!
i am never was so much -> painting <- there ... more mostly _image manipulation_ (e.g. also to change eye-color or others into general)
(later into gimp now .. i am allways miss the old keyboard-shortcuts)
sure ( as i am was young and at job .. i am was really fast into PS5 .)
i am only use since november
then i am better like to use blender and others ... or krita/gimp postprocessing
sure .. but that all is really also much to train to use it .)
you can also post-train the model to have coherent motives
i can do now ( by called "LORA" or also "controlnet" ... many ways [tested only that 2 extensions]:)

i am think at now ... so for me it is to render ~100 ones to find one good (what needs to polish and finetune then!)
they HAVE to look -> SUREAL ( i am like that )
(can do also other styles .. but only on need .)
its how i am like it
no no ... have my own `randoms` for .)

e.g. here also into this one:
sure, i am often use also my old blender lyapunov/mandelbulb fractals as seed
doing this only for fun

( i am never used asocial networks like twitter, telegram or whatsup..etc)
where ?
what do you mean ?

eh, as i am switched from cats to easter-bunny.. it was like horrorshow at first *LOL

you put on github, cool :-)
yesterday by walking i am was seen alo a cat on street here (but was not looked like your blackwhite ones ... more tiger-striped that one)
ah good
(maybe some was seen them)
did you put that images-printings into streat ?

yeeah ... hope they find way back

oh, did also was rendering some robocats again (^_^):


<@371312079526952960> do you like my graphics style 🙂 into Stable Diffusion Art .) ?
-> i am really should write some simple "galery"-app with peote-view (good also to test TextureData.hx and TextureCache.hx again)
did _rendered_ 200 pictures again last night with "easter"-theme 😂

( 4 times lesser ram usage on cpu and gpu )
by `textureData0 = new TextureData( w, h, TextureFormat.LUMINANCE);`
super elegant now into peote-way ;:) -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/gameOfLife/_starter/src/Main.hx#L65>
did you seen last -> gameOfLife code Nanji 🙂 ?
(and float-precision into textures and -data)
Anyway, i am still happy also that peote-view also (it was so long on my list!;) can handle now greyscale only
i made it also pi_xy compatible at now .. but there is still no sample what e.g. loads SVG and then ->pi_xy ->TextureData
(and code is not more then ~100 lines .)
(can make that easy compatible later if it one times run into peote-playground)
for triangles best is to write a little new one (and all for ES2 at first)
my shader is fully quad-optimized
after all -> haxlib
and to make all -> inline documented (that is only 1/2 there at now)
and another DOX more easy building (maybe hxp) ... and some refactoring
and then i am also have to put the last missing features into peote-view (to change texture-smoothing at runtime also easy now)
- galery
- milkpiss game-engine (full rewrote!)
- more blender->2d-game sample with fully compositing at runtime for the multiple-lights stuff
np.. on my todo for next prj. is even only some more what i am also need for myself here
ah
oh, whats that ?
[e.g. first pass is by my macro there]
its by the default haxe-template-engine (but modifyed to let it do all into multiple passes)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/Shader.hx>
my shader-templates are here:
feel free!
-> another sample with textures also
and only if that works on all targets and code looks elegant and easy to understand
best if you do at first one sample without textures!
then include this function into your CustomDisplay: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Program.hx#L1011>
`    public var glTexture(default, null):GLTexture = null;    `
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Texture.hx#L21>
into peote-view you can use Texture.hx
(ALL have to work multiplatform out of the box into peote-view)
only js i am do not wanna have into my samples .)
all can be mixed also i mean!
i am using it to store also SHORT-integers for positions (for lesser buffer-ram usage)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/BufferBytes.hx>
if you put into petoe-views CustomDisplay you can use also the buffering-tools from peote
can see only the "buffering"-code there.
(should work, but you only don't have to use `gl.clear` [clearAll()] .. that is done by peote-view before it start rendering Display by Display)
here also: <https://github.com/TrilateralX/TrilateralBasic/blob/master/src/trilateralBasic/AppGL.hx#L55>
aahh.. thre we have it: <https://github.com/nanjizal/kitGL/blob/master/src/kitGL/glWeb/PlyMix.js.hx#L185>
```haxe
  var data = pen.arr;
  var totalTriangles = Std.int( data.size/7 );
  var red    = 0.;
  var green  = 0.;
  var blue   = 0.; 
  var alpha  = 0.;
  var color: Int  = 0;
  for( i in 0...totalTriangles ){
      pen.pos = i;
      color = Std.int( data.color );
      alpha = alphaChannel( color );
      red   = redChannel(   color );
      green = greenChannel( color );
      blue  = blueChannel(  color );
      gl.beginFill( 0xffffffff );
      gl.addVertex( data.ax*2, data.ay*2, red, green, blue, alpha );
      gl.addVertex( data.bx*2, data.by*2, red, green, blue, alpha );
      gl.addVertex( data.cx*2, data.cy*2, red, green, blue, alpha );
      gl.endFill();
  }
```
have to look like this then:
but hey, that code for example could be nearly copy/paste into CustomDisplay and should also work there
(with beginFill() ... endFill())
this is really the slowest way into opengl
oh.. if it is like into heaps: <https://github.com/nanjizal/cornerContour/blob/main/src/cornerContour/drawTarget/HeapsDraw.hx#L21>
mhm, no LimeDraw
( -1.0 to 1.0 .. or also 0 ... width/height ?)
cool (and what is fastest access for pure haxe triliteral ?)
ah, so internally also works with screencoords ?
but no chance ( only get some latest lime changes inside  ... but now to many errors into follow)
eh, last 1/2h i am tryed to get bhx to run again: <https://github.com/vujadin/BabylonHx/tree/master> (on lime)
mhm, but seems you need it into screen-coordinates for triliteral ? (  so zero-coordinate is into topleft ?)
ah, "pen.addTriangle()" ? (did not find the opengl code)
(and for attributes and "stride" you can also look at here: <https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle>)
*re
here is some simple sample how to draw more then one: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_drawing_a_model.htm>
seeYou
i am at now really have to enter the kitchen (guests here... they look hungry .)
you will find way ...
oh, for my quads i am have same z-depth for all the 4 points
into z-depth you have the choise -> per vertexpoint or per triangle :)
oh, have to cook here at now ... see you later!
(yep, sooo easy also it isnt.. it was there into the sample i am deleted at now [but for quads and Triangle_Strip drawArray/drawArraysInstanced])
(vertexbuffer is smaller then ... another extra one for the colors only per index)
yes, for es3 it is better by gl.drawArraysInstanced ( ... )
(have not the time and delight at now ... need really a _galery_ sample at now and also wanna work again on my old milkpiss-engine for 2d-game)
this is supersimple and likle pure opengl only: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/customDisplay/_starter/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L20>
yep, i am deleted my old proto (what only looked complicate because i am reverse engeneered what my macro normally is generating for quads and textures and all)
simple do how it is _commented out_ into the _starter sample
es2 -> webgl1, es3->webgl2
give it a try, it's not that difficult
2 is enough for triangle_starter_sample
into vertexbuffer then each point also should include the colorvalues, then: <https://docs.gl/es2/glDrawArrays>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/customDisplay/_starter/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L79>
yes, by opengl and drawArray() it would be the same (or a bit faster by instance drawing for es3)
oh, have to cook burgers here for us now (nephew is visiting ;)
both have to work ! :)
(e.g. if animated gif have 10 frames it could create 10 slots)
oh, and cool then also would be to load gif and gif-anims .)
if it works everywhere, i can put the "converting" also inside TextureData then (e.g. createPalette(bytes, ...) and extending the fromFormatPNG(bytes))
ah, yes ... your old sample is near to this .)
16 colors also would be easy afterwards (then have to store one colorindex into upper and the next one into lower 4 bits for data)
So the colors have to put into 1x255 sized RGB/RGBA texture.. and the color-indexes at best into only R or LUMINANCE one
if it works, i can help with sample to display it ( by 2 multi-textures )
oh, needs really a commit then
oh, did you tryed ? .. i ve see that you can fetch the color-table
yes, LUMINANCE or R
oh, and _smooth_ for shrink and expand also will not work then
yes, but our Textures also can not do this by default ( in opengl i am think its to much diff into gl-targets )
only way is to make some indexed one by own and custom shader and only one color channel texture (so 255 different colors) 
and another texture can hold that 255 color values e.g. into a 1x256 sized RGB or RGBA texture
sometimes i am think how to make it with _colours_
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/gameOfLife/_starter/src/GameOfLife.hx#L75>
<@371312079526952960> what do you would improve more ?
oh, and little fix cos some bit was get lost 😂 <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/b92c7591927c4ff38f05fc08a596e1a06853ac50>
<:bugsnaxsmile:1217254545244028939> did optimized it also now (so rules getting inn faster: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/f4739ae458190ddb86f799da661ac186b4fba3ac>
The old _walkcycle_ sample is also extended now to load only the greyAlpha-PNG into LUMINANCE_ALPHA textureFormat: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walkcycle/src/Main.hx#L42>
so all more consistent at now 🙂
```haxe
setFloat(x:Int, y:Int, red:Float, green:Float, blue:Float, alpha:Float = 0.0)
setFloat_RGBA(x:Int, y:Int, red:Float, green:Float, blue:Float, alpha:Float)
...
```
then for float you have it simmiliar:
So after the _underscore_ is allways the expected Format (without extra check at runtime, so faster!)
while only `setColor(x:Int, y:Int, color:Color)` checks the _textureFormat_ and only set what is available (of a color-32Bit Int/UInt-value)
so e.g. these ones is optimized:
```haxe
setColor_RGBA(x:Int, y:Int, color:Color)
set_RGBA(x:Int, y:Int, red:Int, green:Int, blue:Int, alpha:Int)
```
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L99>
I've also changed the way of how to set pixels... its all called now:
setColor... getColor ... and without "Color" if it only sets the values one by one or for speical format (more optimzed then)
anyway, gameOfLife works ;) <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/9bb1b1b5f69a3357ca4b5f63538288fc80011422>
Woah, there was also some Bugs on HTML5:
 in TextureData PNG-encoding ... and also some if you set `zoom` for Display
it detects automatically the textureformat ... but if you wanna have it faster and e.g. only a Red-channel textureformat .. then it can be little bit faster by: setPixelR or getPixelR ..and so on.
normally you only use: setPixel or setPixelFloat
or: getPixel for Integer format
( getPixelFloatRed, getPixelFloatGreen, getPixelFloatBlue, getPixelFloatAlpha  for Float Format)
And more for setPixel and also getPixel works at now into `TextureData`:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L137>
So more helpers into `Color` now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Color.hx#L53> (also some static ones to create!)
did polished TextureData and also Color now for peote-view: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/ce493c8f8eb4b0f924b7e18d9ea720373febfe2f> (also was removing the constructor one commit later ;)
(so you can use `fwith` in fragmentshader)
<https://handmade.network/forums/t/8799-anti-aliasing_in_fragment_shader>, <https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7dfGR4>
have to cook now..see you later
by glsl you have to check neighbor pixels
or you render into greater sized texture and then display it e.g. halfsized and with {smoothShrink:true}
you have to do this also by shader
aahh.. by shader ... nice
but that have to match then the textureFormat
you have also some little bit faster setPixel methods, e.g. setPixelR()
yep, setPixel automatic only set into existing colorchannels
aaah... cool
Do you tested also the new decoding sample for all types of PNG ?
this is on my TODO ... i am not sure to throw an Error then (or alternatively auto-convert)
so there is no check at moment , e.g. if you put a 2 channel TextureData into 1 channel Texture it should crash
(will check performance then by gameOfLIfe ;)
i will put in some functions later to reduce or extend also the channels .. 
what also need is getPixel()
yes, at now it is only important that the textureData have same amount of channels
but did not tested on android here
`new Texture(800, 600, {format:TextureFormat.R});`
yes, but as i am tested here also simple RED works
nowadays (-_-) [ i am miss <@231149223855390721> 🪄 _into that sometimes_ ]
into OpenFL and Lime also all is only going -> slowly step by step
https://discord.com/channels/415681294446493696/1091757488749158410/1221261382335336488
(superfast you know also by default .)
(only if you really need .)
but into fragment-lvl you have to think about that it is processing each pixel
it did only on vertex-shade-level, so that is ok then
what emulates the canvas
for only one
nah, also the shader code is more optimized
for your own later into optimization i mean (into sample its ok!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/shaders/sdf-box-gradient/src/Main.hx#L150>
```haxe
class Canvas implements Element {
    // position in pixel (relative to upper left corner of Display)
    @const @posX var x:Int = 0;
    @const @posY var y:Int = 0;
```
[and for a non-scale-size also set the with and height to that!]
[you can make x and y also `@:const` to `0` for optimization]
that ones i am think i am will using next time .)
or : `FullyDisplayedElement`
or into that ->  `DrawingArea`
i am also think allways ... last time i am did `textureWhereRenderInto` or something
that "html"-ones (into DOM)
you can name it like you wanna ... iam only think sometimes directly that it have something todo with
(or think like to write a web-application ... all have to split into client and serverside)
(e.g. tk, gtk, ... and c++ was really not easy at that time ... into perl it was some better at that time but also not easypeasy and also fully crossplatform by haxe)
.. i am remember the bad days if i am do ui-applications into other promgramming languages and its tools
eh, but nowadays in haxe for me all is really more simple ...
why peote-view is hard to learn if you migrate from other graphic-frameworks
so that i am think is the 2 points
who creates the pixels
what the one is what is rendering into what and what the other one is what is the ones
-> `render2texture` (fbo) renderchain
hey, i am also not sure how to name it into
🙂 (anyway, all is `available` now for our little graphic elements)
*LOL
<@694560611601743893> what the fuck ... you named it "canvas" .-...-.-. -. . .- . ..  🙈 😂 ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/shaders/sdf-box-gradient/src/Main.hx#L151>
my motivation is there at now (thx also to new shadersample by you half...
my interest at moment also is more to fix my computercode
<:kittysecret:1217259729198514306>
but we share _information_ of _strategic nature_ ;:)
(or at the same time <:meowhug:1217268141416255519> )
problem is: we have all "family sharing" .. so we can not play together via steam drm
eh, Umven, Pafnuty and me we all three like to play the new baldursgate .) ....
*LOL
yeah ... really -> coldstart .)
(hard to leave controler also to put hands on keyboard .)
<:bugsnaxsmile:1217254545244028939>
<@689869574883246237> PLEASE SHOW US YOUR LATEST CCCC OOOO DDDDD EEEEEEEEEE 😂
yeah .. absolutely (but not so easy if you start into haxe [like jumping into cold water])
Think you would like to create a game like -> "bindings of isaac"
and also how to use `echo`-physics for `hit`-detection (all is complicate _twice_ then with bodys and element-updating ... but i am also have no better idea for that at now)
At now i am think the Problem he have is to keep overview of more what is possible into haxe-spice
yeah, that will be for -> game later ( my hope is that <@689869574883246237> also can use it some day ♥️ )
and replacing all animations there by simple SD-images from maitag/~semmi/stable-diffusion/
mabye by using _the_ old  `reference demo` .)
Me have to try to start some `galery` demo _really now_ !
haxe is so cool into this
you have to _refactor_ also from time to time .. so to make code better readable and maintable for you!
yeah, better concentrate on this again
puh ~_~
oh, sorry.. hope my renderthing not deflecting you
best approach !
awesome ... that you still not gived up!
remember that project 💓
i can make you also a -> circular -> turn-around-button
(we need more "styles" into peote-ui .)
hey -> BOTH -> OK
WOAH \o/
by unix-pipes? (instead of sockets i mean)
(or make a little video)
(show me if i am visit you sometimes)
shit -> cant not test then here ~~ ... anyway ;:)
and do i am would need special hardware to test that into usecase for ?
why not make this little tool -> `haxelib` also ?
yeah.. iam see ... comma separated
into _functionnaming_
there really the `underscore` makes _sense_ ;:)
<https://github.com/jobf/novation-editing/blob/master/test/ValidateRawParameterData.hx#L68>
ah, cool
haxe also ?
pls list them to me ~~
k
(out of jobfuck 4sure!)
oh, what is thas ones ?
so what is that projects names ?
oh, and how into _priority_ ?
or how to integrate MIDI (there i am absolute `zero knowledge` into)
you are much better into knowledge what is need into `audio` for game-events into best-performance per target
🍻
not if you do it!
[maybe more `consistent` into API and some of "first milestone" only -> ANY WAY ;:)]
what we already have into peote-playground samplespace already .)
At the end that all also only would be a big WRAPPER around all
Half, how do you think about `peote-audio` then ... should i am start into that ? (to have some more complete `lib-set` where all is work together with each other part)
last time i'Ve seen someone who also wrote haxelib for git usage (after looking into code i am not really was sure anymore that this also is only for `github` sucker at now)
you can use also then to make a little showcase for all your game-jam titles 💓
to also write your own little haxelib.
your codingstyle is good enought i am think at nowadays!
(i am only mean `Dox` cos of how simple it is implemented there in kind of a "TOOL")
it also not should generate a `doc` .. it is only to simple `build and put all into html-template`
What is the most prj of your many ones .. what you ever wann'T to be share to others also by 
`haxelib`  ?
and how about `lime-audio` ?
😭
where much of people change code at any time)
(maybe only the onces into really massive-in/out-codeprojects
And i am sure some also not like the "github"-approach into CI
it could be really a timesaver for haxe-developers!
with your one (and our -> loose _approach_ into sample putting in the fun and change it also at any time!)
but there is no good thing yet for -> sampleshowcase (everyone make its own)
i mean -> many using `Dox`
hey, the good is -> there is already a usecase
(but better write a pure lime soundlib at first *^)
for me it would be -> your `masterpiece` into haxelibdevelspace also!
and all good old haxecoders would like it!
it have to work like `dox`
(after that we can use it everywhere ... many haxelibcoders who have samples can also save much of time into maintain its samples into _webshowcase_->e a s y)
sure .. but only -> ONCE
-> `DO IT` -> _haxelib_ also!
Lets not only make it for us alone i mean <:blobhugging:1217266170047103018>
can use your tool Half <:blobstar:1217266321192915075>
Any haxe-libcoder who is take care on his samples
(we can use the same tool also then for peote-view-samples and peote-ui-samples)
so a commandline `tool`, for each one who is organizing its _samples_ like we are doing
you should also make it `universal` .. e.g. as little haxelib also
Half, i am not wanna that your effort into this is never used
[i can `redirect` peote.de/view then easy by _Apache_ to ~/half/peote-view later!]
(there is still some redirecting to my old gfxl site for that students there at teaching-job *lol ... have much todo there to setup the server new some day!)
<http://peote.de/view>
better lets do use allways the same path ... lemme think
😂
*LOL
to ocamlcomplicate
to edit that link there ... mhm *lol -.... no no no
And your script then is parsing the readmes also
so if you on github into sample folder .. there have to be a link into readme (and best we try to make also a single called `screenshot.jpg` file for each of them)
mhm, but have to be _linked_ into both directions
and then you can finetune it at any time
hey, and also you can do it on maitag.de/~half
we can put a direct link into readme!
yes *hugs
ahh.. yeah, i am remember
(and sftp all into same step on maitag into 10s only)
again
if i am `merge` .. i can also run that script
i mean ... how often do you put new sample inside
(non->automatic)
better we host also all on maitag.de
i am don'T wanna make me depend into -> microsofts githubshit only i mean
(to keep the io.host allways updated)
(or lets call it also then from a supersimple githubaction)
and then only `call` it once (on windows and linux)
at any time
i mean i am also wanna change file/folder-names
and is it automatically recursively traversing all folders and subfolders ?
yes, but is it really flexible and easy to maintain ?
only `hxp build html5` then, to make all -> io.github compatible
write hxp-script (i can do that!) what build them all!
apropos -> samplespace ... Half, we really should also now (before peote-view is into haxelib)
(it have to not need longer time to understand as some hours for larger demo-code also!)
or better -> into a new "demo" folder
more samples for game-protos also!
What we more need than nested Elements for our workflow then is ->
yes (also all games not looking the same at the end)
then all can be super->optimized from the beginning!
what is updated at what of time or in depend of input
so you have to `plan` you Game into that before a little bit
etc
etc
one for static Background Elements ...
one Program for _effects_
e.g. one Program for game-specific kind of elements
i am think all the time it is better to use it as it is at now
hey, but for really optimized CUSTOM game-mechanic and _visuals_ ....
(each element than only have to store a _reference_ to the `Program` where it is inside of Buffer)
so all can use also different kind of shadercode
we can even use many programs behind the wheel, for each texture another one
yeah *lol
than we have some kind of -> mini-openfl *LOL ;:)
All is `flat` behind the wheels ... but if you move an Element, it also have to move all its childs recursively
element.addElement(anotherElement)
(i make an `Element` only like a `tree ADT` then into a node there)
it can be easy implemented by sample into playground i mean as another way
so you only add sprites and sprites inside of sprites
i am also thought about some one where you have -> nested Sprites only (like into openfl)
yeah.. you can easy make -> blueprint _Starters
(or any Program inside each Display also possible)
into peote the way is -> en/disable only Display (or add remove it)
ah ok
(but superflexible instead)
there i am think is no "default" approach yet
what you mean by -> scene switching
is the RenderToTexture -> chaining
What really complicate (but not sure at now how can be made more easy with some helpers)
and visual preloader is simple to realize with peote-view super-easy with its Loader already
also state/scene management really depends on kind of game
(some day -> `peote-audio` ;:)
for sound i am allways think there should be used a separate library
<@689869574883246237> also have to use `echo` at now for collision-checking
ah ok
so what do you had to write for your own what Flixel is have _buildin_ ?
(even what is working there at now is fully enough for good game-ui)
and for sure all into peote-ui
The only for game what i am really would need is ready now -> `input2action`
(it also have some kind of "extra" complexitivity)
i am also not sure i am ever would using it for myself
did tested it the last time and not found inside of haxelib also (forgot what i am did last time .. installed it from git or not)
i am not sure with aidens also (is it still into haxelib ? .. it also only named "ecs" 😂 )
ECS also ?
what is the most there you are missing ?
(what you miss from Flixel)
Also Half, you told last time you need also more features for -> GAME-coding
then i can concentrate on other missing features of peote-view again
<:blobcattongue:1217267686854361178>
<@371312079526952960> can you make a super simple lime sample with using of all your libs into that ? ( so only simple svg-string and the size of the _have-to-generate_ Pixelimage should be given as input)
and OUTPUT into end of chain is into Pixelimage format (all have to be use pure haxe only and no canvas or something from other dependencies i mean!)
so e.g. to parse a String what is contain the SVG as INPUT
Anyway, i am not wan't spent to much time at now only for dynamic rendered triangles into peote-view...
would be also cool to use it with Triliteral and justpath and all to 
1) render it into Pixelimage
2) Pixelimage -> TetureData -> Texture
for es3 you can also use UBO and VBO (and all is best optimized for html5 and webgl2 nowadays .)
ES2:  glDrawArrays()
ES3: glDrawArraysInstanced()
(for best performance it also have to use _instancing_ for sure: <https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing>)
(there is many samples ... one e.g. here [unoptimized!] <https://jsfiddle.net/headchem/r28mm/10/>)
Or you do simple by pure lime-gl code inside your CustomDisplay!
then also a triangle should came out by this
so it is doing all on shaderside (and ignores position and size if they are not set and used inside of shader)
and then a new `@vertexShaderTmp`
Better approach maybe would if i am only using `@:custom` vertex-attributes
mhm, as i am looked into my last customShader->reverse engeneering sample (what used the macro-generated-square-code directly) is really to much effort .... good that i am deleted this
It really depends also on the font and letter/line spacings i am thing ...
cools stuff (how crazy would look to use the fully unicode-bitmapfont for <:blobstar:1217266321192915075> )
can do also ansi-colors ? (remeber seen this also into as3 sometimes .. but only image to ascii-art)
thx .. see you later!
have to cook 🍝 now (of `type` `Cabonara.hx` for me and <@689869574883246237>  *lol;)
😂
then all is fully targetcompatible!
But you should split your glsl vertex and fragmentshader into 2 parts (one for es2 and other for es3)
then it should be best crosscompatible
Write your gl-triangles without UBOs and only using: `gl.drawArrays ( ... );`
ok, its deleted: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/customDisplay>
moment
should i am better delete it until it is only a prototype ?
there i am only "unrolled" yet into all what is done by Element.hx macro (but manually!)
that one is not finish ... i am will delete it from repo now
here you can draw mass of triangles: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/customDisplay/_starter/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L79>
the "square" ones is here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/shaders/shapes/src>
Will also look at the prototype there again ... pls only cook up from that "starter" sample there at now (the other one i am still working on to make more compatible to all of existing design or peote-view _way of renderoptimization/features_)
What i am really would like to have for a custom `DisplayTriangles.hx` Display is also to use the `render2texture`-feature then later (and all without "textures" for sure .. that mapping would be to much effort to fit the `Program` for!)
(most render-engines use only the first way!)
(e.g. peote-views quads it optimized for both ... update full buffer or only one element at time)
Another question: is it allway need to update ALL triangles at once .. or also should it be possible to update  _one by one_ partly into `vertexbuffering`
[-1.0, -1.0] the top-left corner point
so [0.0, 0.0] would be the middle of the Display into that case
cos if internally triliteral using -1.0 to 1.0 .. it would be better into performance i am do also into that
(also: float or integer there if screen-coords ;)
or into screen pixel-coordinates ?
from -1 to 1
question is <@371312079526952960>, how you you wanna set up the coordinate-points for the triangles ?
yes, if he have time and likes it ... why not (but i can also make a fully sample for optimized arraydrawing/indexedDrawing gl-optimization of many triangles the same)
(is into peote-playground also!)
(that was the old -> emulation)
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/shader-shapes/>
what i am did into past was emulating triangles by fragmentshader with the existing square-approach only (but by custom display you can do whatever you wanna now!)
(and part into slots and tiles .. thats a fully different approach as if you draw triangles only)
no, i am told you often that -> squares can be better map to square textures
(without any of OpenGL-hacks what makes the code more unreadable)
You can also put your opengl triangledrawing code inside <@371312079526952960> (but please also make it cross-target into lime-gl-way [for both:es2/es3])
Or you put the simple lime triangledrawing code inside by copy/paste (but there it is only draw ONE triangle .)
so you can have 3D inside a "layer" (Display) into peote-views scenerendergraph
Another usecase could be also to _inject_ Away3d or maybe better old bhx (babylon3d haxeport) cos Away is depends on OpenFL-bitmaps to much maybe
If you really need some OpenGL-code there (e.g. opengl also can draw simple lines superfast in order),
you should start with this sample there: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/customDisplay/_starter/src/CustomDisplay.hx>
hey, that only not finished yet  .... if you really wanna have it quick and dirty i can also make it into one day (but not good to use all into `Program`-features then)
but maybe this also can be done by glsl-shadercode for best performance.
( never did that kind of fractales before, but this can be really interesting, e.g. there is also not so much crosstarget software at now what using gpu-optimization to render them )
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame
A good usecase for drawing the thin curves would be e.g. -> flame-algorithm:
To draw the triangles into best of performance i am need some good time and free head (last days much of pain here with 🦷-tortureshit, so can't concentrate much on coding)
e.g. there is many ones with only 1 or 2 colorchannels (with new feature now all will be use lesser gpu-ram for this into assets <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-view-remaster-demos/assets/showreel/>)
greyscale is very important into computergraphics, think also at _lightmaps_ etc ..
i am also can use it now for old reference-demo, there e.g. is compositing made at runtime: http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-view-remaster-demos/bin/
( here also the .blend file of what is able to png-create there: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/tree/main/texture/assets> )
So it can load also grey and greyAlpha ones now without overhead, here is sample to test them all:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/texture/src/TextureDataPNG.hx#L67>
I've added custom png-encoding by format-lib now for all TextureFormats:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L212>
ah, i've also helped old friend today to setup internet again (it was broken and needed new router-setup)
<https://github.com/ShaharMS/Vision/blob/main/src/vision/tools/ImageTools.hx#L71>
but can't find it back 😂  ... will look into "vision" code (remember seen it there also)
mhm, some day i am already used format to decode png
(or something at job?)
oh, the one with SVG 😍 ?
i am still at this point:
```haxe
public static function fromFormatPNG(bytes:Bytes) {
        // TODO
}
```
(81KB -> grey+Alpha, 67KB -> only grey)

but gimp can do both ... so this is by gimp:
blender can only save png with grey and not greyAlpha....
`F12` renders and creates all 3 PNGs

did created simple .blend file at now to save all available PNG formats by Composer:
maybe tonight (have to go out now to get some fresh air 🚶  .) ..seeYouLater
so we can use: `Loader.bytes(...)` and then only:
`var textureData = TextureData.fromPNG(bytes)`
especially if the png only contains _grey/alpha_-values
( and then the TextureFormat have to be automatically also LUMINANCE or LUMINANCE_ALPHA into that case )
What also is need for TextureData is to decode PNG->Bytes directly by format-lib
I will concentrate now to make better TextureData -> Texture (opengl-side) if both formats not matches (have to trace out some "warning" msg also then ... so best approach should be to create TextureData also with lesser colorchannels if Texture is also using lesser ones to save GPU-RAM)
good is that we have "_starter" now ... so good to test easy by Lime for all targets
yes
ah
oh, lime also parsing svg ?
yeah, that would be really cool to use also SVG inside of peote-view
*lol, yep, thats makes the confusion complete 😂
(anyway, will disable this sometimes into this IDE here cos it always popup then while coding)
while using vscodium at now, and the "color"-chooser .. i am think there it seems to be also ARGB ...mhm
and you can use `Loader.text(...)`
no, but the haxe-logo should be somewhere on haxe website
This would be cool !
pls use the haxe-logo.svg for playground-sample
yeah \o/
(while `texture.setData()`)
then i have to create new Bytes from RGBA what only contains its RG values
and TextureData -> RGBA
e.g. if Texture -> RG
i have also to put some code inside Texture there, if TextureData have not the same format as Texture
peote-views Color is allways also: RGBA (like into html colors!)
So i am think i have to change it there to use also all the transparent-features from pi_xy
(and then it is create new Bytes by iterating to convert from ARGB to RGBA)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L240>
yes, but if you using not peote-views Color it have to change here:
yep, also neko and html5
so all double knotted 🪢 :)
but only if i set the Pixels with peote-view_s_ `Color` 😅
It also works by using directly the Bytes: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L236>
ok, the simple sample for pi_xy is working now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/pixelimage/_starter>
to draw custom opengl things you have now "CustomDisplay"s, but i am not finished to make a fully sample with shadertemplate for triangles yet
ok, i've installed pi_xy now (was need also iterMagic to install!) , it also creates an Image...
will try to make a simple sample later tonight and the TextureData-converting
`Die Farbe.`
so:
and article is: "`die`" (instead of "the")
into german it is simple: "`Farbe`"
<@371312079526952960> <@694560611601743893> mhm... is into brittain saying -> `colour` ? (or was that into french~)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/vision/src/Main.hx#L11>
e.g. into vision you see how is even into "Color" 😅  ->
thats also why i am renamed all into `TextureData` for peote-view at that time
(and then automatic cast from that bytes into `TextureData` .. so simmiliar as for what works for Lime and Vision images at now)
i am personally really would like to have that sample what is parsing SVG and put into pixelimage
yes, no hurry also .... my goal is to put peote-view finally also into haxelib (so all much more easy to install and test everywhere)
ahh.. ok
maybe should rename the `pixelimage` folder there also into `nanjizael` and then some subfolders .. e.g.  `pi_xy` and `justpath` !
(that old "starter" there is stupid ... have to delete or rename it ...
 ... that one is more to have an _input_-field for hscript or XML code ...
 ... so my idea was to put something inside there at runtime and then see what pixelimage-lib or justpath is generating from)
wanna have it here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/pixelimage>
<@694560611601743893> what do i am need to install into dependencies to make sample run ?
<@371312079526952960> will implement also soon! ( still was cleaning up all the mass of samples for new api-changes into peote-view there into playground ... but now all is up to date!)
awesome \o/
seeYou <:blobcattongue:1217267686854361178>
will look later (sry but have to go afk now ... need some natural light and its still sunny outside)
yeah, simple @from casting there is enough for a first 🪢 ....
(its simple only need to read the `Bytes`)
(you don't have to blow up your code for the peote-view renderer)
if this works, i can do the other direction simmiliar!
to read the Bytes from your pixel-imageformat
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L234>
the first "hook" have to be here:
yep, that better later! (also have to go out at now .. need some fresh air ;)
its pure lime
oh, for peote-view you don't need openfl
i've just tryed neko at now, but should work on all lime-gl targets (maybe i am have still another bug inside?)
step by step <:blobcat:1217259154629201920>
(at first better only let use peote-view to simple display that image)
yes, that way i am have to implement more clean afterwards
(and all same simple sample to keep it coherent into using)
So the user can choose what to use: limes Image, visions Image or pi_xy image!
(also the other "direction", to fetch it back -> i am need to implement later .. at now there is only some "readPixelUInt8()" dirty stuff ... wanna make it better afterwards if someone renders into that texture and to fetch the TextureData back)
```haxe
// create a new pixelimage (pi_xy)
...
// draw something inside
...
// create new peote-view texture
var texture = new Texture(512, 512);
// put pi_xy-image data into peote-view texture
texture.setData(image);
```
to more easy remember later how it works
pixelimage -> same
lime-image -> TextureData
vision-image -> TextureData
best would be if it is coherent to my other stuff, e.g.
mhm
and then another more complex one
or better -> simple rectangle only like into "vision" for the _starter-sample!
and replacing the old "starter" here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/pixelimage>
oh, looks good (should be also into playground!)
`#if pi_xy` .... `#end` into my TextureData.hx , so if someone have pixelimage installed he can using it also (and peote-view to use the edited image)
and then:
wanna get sure that the "TextureFormat" matches
better simple at first , e.g. also drawing only a rectangle or something
toBytes also ?
can it not be same for pixelimage-lib ?
```haxe
    #if vision
    // Vision: https://lib.haxe.org/p/vision/
    @:from
    static public inline function fromVisionImage(image:vision.ds.Image) {
        return new TextureData(image.width, image.height, TextureFormat.RGBA, image.toBytes(vision.ds.PixelFormat.RGBA ) );
    }
    #end
```
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L223>
for "vision" it was only need 3 lines 😂
oh, so much ?
The new Sample to draw inside TextureData is here: 
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/texture/src/TextureDataInOut.hx>
i am forgot to commit that last night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3zPLUXNoV8
(sure, but also into "wording" *LOL :;)
eh.. into haxe-chat tonight -> S T R A N G E again
np
awesome
\o/
"vision" also works
here is playground-sample: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/vision/src/Main.hx#L50>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L223>
wow, "vision" lib works out of the box (moment, will try to draw also something inside!)
now into peote-playground reopo !
ok, i am should try out with pixelimage and vision libs
<:cathappy:1217259169607057610>
<@371312079526952960> puh -> fixed now <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/262448bc7f23daf46a9d4499201138f42a8d7ba5>

if i am do same into reverse here manually -> it works!
here is how it does inside haxe.io.Bytes:
```haxe
    /**
        Store the 32 bit integer at given position (in low endian encoding).
    **/
    public inline function setInt32(pos:Int, v:Int):Void
    {
        #if neko_v21
        untyped $sset32(b, pos, v, false);
        #else
        set(pos, v & 0xFF);
        set(pos + 1, v >> 8 & 0xFF);
        set(pos + 2, v >> 16 & 0xFF);
        set(pos + 3, v >>> 24 & 0xFF);
        #end
    }
```
reverse order: ABGR .... what the hell 😂
i am think its here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L90>
<@371312079526952960> now the `byteorder`-_swizzling_ opens its fully potential *LOL ;:)

but not for Yellow ONES 🙈 *lol:

for set red pixels it works:
OH, tryed out the first sample at now and still have a BUG
<:blobcatfacepalm:1217267423561121933>
also that long missed (breaking!;:) change from `setImage` into `setData`!
(need to update all samples one by one now!)
i did it bravely at now <:bugsnaxsilly:1217254357138014268> -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/2e3eeffd4805235c47c592915a54f3c92de5d771>
ah, you also need more samples 🙂 ?
and if the "Order" is not exactly same as RGBA, its also no problem ( a simple shader can do it later also into rendering without extra effort )
yep, into pixelimage its better to convert (and best without to iterate, e,g, if you do like 1) drawing in 2) update Texture 3)draw again .... and so on
so to convert @from/@to my `TextureData` i have to _blit_ that out at first (can not use the Bytes reference directly i mean)
the only problem into "vision" i am think is that Shahar is storing the with and height into the first bytes (like own header ;)
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/vision/>
jo
(e.g. if you look into "vision"-lib, there its all more easy to understand for coders who not fully dived inside already)
but also hard to read for others i am think
yeah, looks all really flexible into your implementation
(it is not nessessary, but maybe more easy to find if bug later into all the abstracts-castings into queue with that arraybufferviews)
i mean e.g. here: <https://github.com/nanjizal/pi_xy/blob/main/src/pi_xy/Pixelimage.hx#L467>
was seen this last time somewhere as you had that bug there
.. will be more easy to find bugs if you set them (especially into the abstract casting ones)
you really also should try to use more strict code-style ....
e.g. i am was last time also seen that you even not declare `return-types` of functions ...
ah, cool
(especially if all also is `inline`d)
oh, i am thought abstracts have no overhead at runtime
no hurry (at now peote-view is still also not inside haxelib-repo ... don'T wanna also change lots into API after that point then)
\o/ O KEY!
(cos it sounds double into e.g.: `textureData.data` 😅 )
(last time i am really thought about to rename ".data" there into ".bytes" also)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L32>
so i am not have to implement this into peote-view!
e.g. drawing rects, circles ... with or without antialiasing etc
useful for us would be to use your or shahars lib for simple drawing functionality
i know
and to abvoid iterations on CPU you can directly use the `Bytes` as it is and only put 1 line of glsl-code inside to change order how you want!
anyway, important only is how many colorchannels, so 3 or 4 into most cases
it should be also possible (simple shader then can do that _swizzllebizzle_ very easy on GPU)
if you wanna directly put your Bytes inside of TextureData ones, i mean for ARGB
best would be more samples (need also some simple drawing ones at now here for the `TextureData` bridge!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Color.hx#L48>
i've added last time also `luminance` there ... not sure its the correct way,
would be good also to have more into HSV there (have some ideas about improving API there?)
😂
e.g.: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50889145/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-swizzle-channels-in-opengl>
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7251772/what-exactly-constitutes-swizzling-in-opengl-es-2-0-powervr-sgx-specifically>
theoretically you also can only put argb into rgba and then change that order by opengl _swizzling_ or by simple custom shader
if you cast it to (UInt) there should be also no problem with the uppest sign-bit
(i am think argb and so on is all by historical reason for some hardware/formats)
```haxe
    inline function get_rgb () return  this >> 8;
    inline function get_argb() return (this >> 8) | (a << 24);
    inline function set_rgb (rgb:Int)  { this = ( rgb << 8) | a; return rgb; }
    inline function set_argb(argb:Int) { this = (argb << 8) | (argb >> 24); return argb; }
```
its here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Color.hx#L28> by getter/setters:
yes, for OpenGL its better into RGBA order to have all at most compatible

<:bugsnaxsmile:1217254545244028939>
<@231149223855390721> that little demo was really my _masterpiece_ into _`lime` at that time_ <:hurray:1217262736484859995>
<@694560611601743893> at this place it is `write` into `img` -> <https://github.com/openfl/lime-samples/blob/master/demos/GameOfLife/Source/CellAutomation.hx#L45>
cool would be to make it run on GPU also (maybe that one better into playground ;:)
<https://github.com/openfl/lime-samples/tree/master/demos/GameOfLife/Source>
<:cathappy:1217259169607057610>
oooh... half, or what do you think about to migrate my old lime game of life sample into peote-view-sample space at now
i am think i should create a sample now what paints a maze
yeah <:blobcheer:1217265725169991731>
any -> i am let it as it IS at now ! (better to understand then also into opengl-context)
<:bloboro:1217271174929846352>
and for asset efficiently usage of only greyscale or grey+alpha (shit, i am should all what i am have of "LUMINANCE" into `namespace` there at now rename into shorter: "GREY" <:blobcatfacepalm:1217267423561121933>
<@694560611601743893> for my shader-fun stuff i am anyway only need R, RG, RGB or RGBA
( and `write` is no longer need ;:)
We should both only implement the `read`-functionality into our lib-spaces!
so also no one have to foster both ways of en/de-codedirection ...mhm
<:catsnuggle:1217265214127603853>
<@371312079526952960> this here is also obsolete nowa: <https://github.com/nanjizal/pi_xy/blob/main/src/pi_xy/formats/PeoteImage.hx> ... lets better split the task into this way:
i am put code in, to load/create my `TextureData.hx` (bytes) from Pi_XY
and you can also do same into other way back to (into using the `format` property there)
optimized for RG-format then is: `textureData.setPixelFloatRG(x,y,red,green)`
```haxe
var textureData = new TextureData(w, h, TextureFormat.FLOAT_RG);
// makes all in Red (cos Green is 0.0 by default:
textureData.clearFloat(1.0);
```
i did updated also the old reaction/diffusion-simmulation with  float-precision, so that is more optimized at now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/shaders/multipass/reaction-diffusion/src/Main.hx#L48>
<@694560611601743893> and we also should test it at now <:catpalm:1217264793786912858> ..maybe by drawing something into all available formats ..
so it could directly set up into a peote Textue->Slot !
<@371312079526952960> so if you wanna we can make a sample now where you draw something by pi_xy and then i cast it same as with lime
( <https://github.com/nanjizal/pi_xy/blob/main/src/pi_xy/Pixelimage.hx#L465>)
```haxe
@:from
static public inline function fromPiXYImage(image:pi_xy.Pixelimage) {
  return new TextureData(image.width, image.height, TextureFormat.RGBA, image.getBytes() );
}
```
but have also `setPixel(x:Int, y:Int, color:Color)` now,
that one is using only the color-channels what is match the TextureFormat (and there is also more optimized functions)
Maybe can be simmiliar now for pi_xy lib
so e.g. this here is to load data inside from Lime-Image: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L205>
Was switching also to `Bytes` now to hold all the pixels because this is most easy to convert then
<@371312079526952960> <@694560611601743893> was improving the TextureData.hx now to handle the new TextureFormat stuff <:blobcookie:1217259183452454923> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L32>
(that @const and @formula is good if you e.g. wanna have the pivot-point allways into the middle or somewhere calculated by e.g. the size)
```haxe
@pivotX public var px:Float;
@pivotY public var py:Float;
```
or let it there as it was and change element-properties/metatags to this:
```haxe
public function new(positionX:Float=0, positionY:Float=0, width:Int=100, height:Int=100, c:Int=0xFF0000FF, rotation:Float=0)
    {
        this.x = positionX;
        this.y = positionY;
        this.w = width;
        this.h = height;
        this.c = c;
        this.r = rotation;
    }
```
try this:
```haxe
this.px = pivotX;
this.py = pivotY;
```
this will make error into constructor (the "new"-function) of your Sprite:
oh, if you wanna change it .. then no @const and @formula is need
😘
(there you only have to change "radius" then afterwards and also the size is calculated automatically .. all runs more efficiently then, e.g. you spawn mass of elements it needs also lesser RAM on GPU)
here is also some sample, e.g. how to create a _circle_:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/echo/gravityOnIntersect/src/Circle.hx#L9>
so "@const" means that you can not change it later,
and "@formula" then is how to calculate the value by other properties (at runtime by shader glsl-code)
e.g.:
```haxe
@sizeX var w:Int;
@sizeY var h:Int;

// using @formula to inject it into shadercode automatically:
@pivotX @const @formula("w*0.5") var px:Float;
@pivotY @const @formula("h*0.5") var py:Float;
```
there is also a trick how to set it automatically into the middle all the time
(`Float` should also work)
you can do like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/element/Elem.hx#L19>
have only kha-armory3d-setup here for hl->c, but for 2d i am really prefare `lime build hl` with my peote-renderer (did also not found time yet to make the TextureData.hx bridge ready, maybe end of week)
https://discord.com/channels/804476992400392304/1091778536152510624/1213832762520375318
oh, need to install libsdl2-dev?
mhm, never installed ceramic... maybe cos of the underline? (if you add another lib, is it working?)
good night and don't worry ... it really also is existing more trivial programminglanguages ( or looks whats going up into python nowa .. for some stuff you need to install a fully docker-image or py-extra sandboxing .. and all totally TORCH-ai-DRIVENhype!
yeah, Rudy for me is one of the last heros there into -> keeping mind clean for what is need
(e.g. the old fine or how name was ... from old haxeconferences ... still make its own music-promos only *lol ;:)
yeah .. and the "media-operator" --- > for "social" is only NB at now 🙈
(and mass of cat-images .. allways the same ... where is the old bunnymarks .)
(and not all that mass of friday night funkies .)
haxe needs more old hardcorecoders i am think!
(what iam was seen today -> fascinating!)
apropos ... <@689869574883246237> still working on new Armory-Game
kha i am only know know since last summer and my Armory3d->Trip
really another kind of approach ... this is what i am only found of inTerest into
yeah, as i am looked into ceramic there was even no "src" folder anymore
(lime is really same as kha or heaps into access to all what is need for 2d)
hey, then try to use more peote-view + lime
i am think your codestyle also is unique Nanji
e.g. if iam read some code .. i can tell you after 10 min it is from Nicolas or not!
yeah, into Nicolas code .. you also will find Type->forcing only if it is really need .)
heaps together with castledb, hxbit and all the stuff is really -> `productionready`
into peote you have to `think into`!
i am also liked much AS3 (also as2 .... only as1 was really _tricky_ sometimes to keep overview about your code)
buuut .. heaps also have `h3D` (and super cool integrated ... i am was looking long time into code there .. much better into some of "production" also versus Armory3d [there is more khotic .)]
(anyway -> lime is my B A S E ... it is RUN everywhere .)
(but its ok .. heaps-code is the ones what mostly seems clean for me .. much more even than lime ones by <@231149223855390721> )
jo.. heaps allways only concentrate on its targets what need to publish the games from company .)
ah..so the old luxe-guy ?
what is so cool into that ceramic-framework and who is the creator ?
i am not sure about
Also your "friend" NB is writing also haxeui-backend for at now
i am not understand the "hype" about
eh, go me away with ceramic ....


(the other is allways `null` .)
for TextureData i am handle all _separate_ ... more simple to keep it handle there ... so Float OR UInt8 and nothing more
for what usecase ? (into image-processing only blender i am know ..also gimp and krita maybe nowadays using is ... e.g. to have large-scale lightnings ... for image-postprocessing you also need that extra precision per pixel-color)
awesome 😍 .. what was it ?
\o/
do it like you would read into 1 or 2 years (so you easy can dive into code backAgain!)
np (thats is more what i am like to do [instead of documentation u know ;:)])
"setImage" to "setData" -> i will fix it into all the samplecodes there into some hours
Also if i am did last changes into "namespace" for Texture.hx from
yeah ..thats best place for
if you need "name" or "folder" .. feel free to create into our playground there°
yep
💓
its really amazing ... i am totally like sucha demostuff
http://maitag.de/~half/2024/
How was your last sample constructed ? (where you get shadercode from and how was into implementing ?)
(e.g. remember that ones where you make drawing pixels also by peote-view `elements` \o/)
we still have much there Half ... also like your great work into samples so much!
to Nanjis and Shahars great Tools also !
🌉 🌉 🌉 🪗  🌉  🌛
and then much samples into playground to build
-> directly into TextureData.hx .)
-> MAZE-generation
anyway ... the PLAN is
-> you can also grab only some separate channels by lime-imagetools
as i am remember
i am think for RGBA and RGB our `lime`-base is really best for all targets
(he also make separate for javascript ... but using a "tempory"-canvas there)
as i am looked last time into `vision`-lib it also was interesting how Shahar is doing it
yeah, our "Loader"-tool can really easy do all this (only hashlink have that old bug!!!)
into past i am often had to write image-galeries for job (my best client -> universal music [did it with own flowplayer plugin and also perl on serverside])
for imagegalery-demo i am need to play arond also with imagemagick more to put all thumbs directly into e.g. 16x16 tilesheet imgs also
sucha stuff i am really liked at that time (nowadays internet is so fast, it doesn't matter here anymore)
so you only see every second line and so on
or png also have that feature
`progressive` img loading (for web with gifs especially)
do you remember that old:
I am often remember into times where internet was slow
do you know that you also can load the texture-data while still using the textures (so still while the game is running .. if you set image-data inside .. it still is visible)
also now .. if you need much more textures for gamejam -> no problem to fill up the GPU to limit :)
thank you

*OH NOOOOOO 😂
slots NaN: 0 x Infinity
texture size: 0 x Infinity
... sorry.. thats really painful for me .)
if there is only `one` slot (the older algorithm still handling this ... i need some fix for the new one ...
`optimalTextureSize(1, 800, 600, 0xffff)`
shit, i am still found one 🙈

for TextureData i am only need `UInt8Array` ... don'T ask me why but at that time i am think i was choosing cos of that was best working together with lime and its OpenGL -> ES2/3 wrapping for all devices i am can test here
(lime is still fast there i am think .. also for jpeg on all targets ... not sure about `format`-lib overhead into)
😂 not wanna know how much time it would need to load 500 images
`optimalTextureSize(500, 800, 600, 0xffff);`
woah.. also crazy to see how many images would fit into modern GPU:
and if the images into folder is same as a `primenumber` ... then it have to automatically have to arrange if not all fits into one great image into a row
Nanji, i am have so many stable-diffusion ai-images at now .. i am need a  GALERY-software ;:)
( so only 1 slot overhead if you wanna store 7 images[TextureData] into your Texture)
8 slots: 2 x 4
texture size: 200 x 240
`var p = optimalTextureSize(7, 100, 60, 500);`
OOH... i am was wring before .. the algotihm give it better 😂 :
(maybe i am still did error there and not seen yet)
<https://try.haxe.org/#6aaBCafb>
hey, but now i am also did put my super algorithm into try.haxe
we should test this for peote-views TextureData !!!! \o/
to see how all is _chained_ together into abstract-casting from typeTOtype
mhm ... would need some hours (directly after weakup and clean ;)
mhm... see nowhere also return-Types (to hard to find error for me tonight 😅 )
`this.img.traceGrid();` is returning something ?
what is "u8.traceGrid()" is `return` ?
🍻
cool stuff Nanji *hugs
woah.. iam getting crazy into try.haxe *lol ;:) [to many abstracts of abstracts to dive more into at now]
both time -> `.traceGrid()` <-
```hx
public function traceGrid(){
        this.img.traceGrid();
    }
``` (line 549)
(more error-feedback without DCE!)

( @:transient is there into Picture-abstract ... maybe something simmiliar )
cos of your error , maybe something of abstract-behavior if using same name there again
aah
oooh.. some new haxe-feature .. cool
(istn that a "keyword" ) ?
into line 25 ?
what is  `return switch( abstract ){ ... ` ?
yes.. really complex algorithm ... i am so happy to get it running ... oh, it also would create 200 x 300 into this case cose that one is more _quadratic_
(so only 3 slots is overhead!)
(where you have 12 slots at the end ...oh... into that case it also would make: 5x2 slot-tiling ... so 500 x 120 texture)
it automatically make you 4 x 3 slots then ( so 400 x 180 sized texture)
but if maximum size is only 500 or lesser ....
then it try to put into a 700 x 60 texture at first
so e.g. you have 7 imageslots ... and all 100 x 60 of size
c) it find the tiling what using minimum of texturespace
b) to be into limit of "maxTextureSize" .. e.g. you can say: the maximum of Texture can only be 4000 x 4000 pixels
a) to keep it at most -> quadratic
and then my new algorithm (the old one only works for powerOfTwo) automatic find the best size for the Texture to hold all that image-slots
e.g. 13
so you give your image-size ( e.g. 800 x 600 ) and the amount of "slots"
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/TexUtils.hx#L119>
have to show you:
a supercool new algorithm for texture-automatic tiling 😂
hey nanji, propos, i am wrote (the full last night up to noon)
(mhm...i am think maybe it was only by compilerdefines and the `_` underscore into naming there)
pi is also for numeric fun
yeah, pixelimage was really a bit long!
(remember some haxeglitch somewhere ... not sure it was into a lib or somewhere else into that)
i mean i would use `pi-xy`
but not care about the underscore (since some times with lib and underscore into name i am switches all to only `-` ones)
pi_xy sounds good
😂 iam sometimes found code into sample what was forgotten ... e.g. today i found your "png"-writer into the "fbo-painting-sample"
(was to try out UI there to have INPUT for some xml-definition to use your lib Nanji)
have to refactor here... i am roughtly remember only and stat i am stopped there: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/pixelimage/_starter/src/Main.hx>
jo
\o/
<@694560611601743893> do you also remember olf folder where we was testing into playground
apropos, can i am use you lib also to load png what only include one or two "luminance/greyscale" (+/- alpha) channels?
yes, that means the c++ linker can not found the sdl-lib ( e.g. on debian thats often the "-dev" ones, so try: "apt-get install libsdl2-dev"
Do you wanna make all your tools now also NME compatible 🙂 ?
i am also put all the core sampletestings out of and into another repo!
and then all will be much easy to install as ever ...
<@371312079526952960> by the way .. i am really wanna put "peote-view" lib also now into `haxelib`-repo ... that last "incoherent"-stuff with the texture-api and new TextureDATA (+limes opengl es2 minimum) i am think i can finally put into "final state" 0.91 soon!
ah, I just saw your post in the NME issues (i think hugh or someone will answer you tomorrow).
i didn't even know that now for web everything runs via jsprime and emscripten 😅, maybe only some missing dependencies on that  pop_os (looks like ubuntu based, also never tryed .. using only debian here since long)
oh, the last time i am used was 2013 (<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxenme/>), so long ago and since that time i am also not tryed again

<@689869574883246237> guck mal , <@694560611601743893> hat seine game-jam code hochgeladen: <https://github.com/jobf/samurai-game-jam/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK9Z3L44DkY
(das ist nen häufiger Fehler am Anfang)
```
// block
{
   ANWEISUNG;
   ANWEISUNG;
   ANWEISUNG; ANWEISUNG; 
}
// nachm schliessen des blocks KEIN SEMIKOLON
```
denk auch immer an das Semikilon nach jeder Anweisung:
(und innerhalb der "update"-loop dann immer guckt was grad die aktuelle Bewegung sein soll)
(da man meistens ja bei "onKeyDown" die Bewegung starten ... und bei "onKeyUp" diese wieder beenden will)
(wie man es mit dem "update"-event verknuepft lass uns mal an deinem Rechner zusammen probieren ... muss erstmal Abendbrot jetzt machen .)
prima \o/
```hx
public override function onKeyDown (key:KeyCode, modifier:KeyModifier):Void {
        
        if (key == KeyCode.LEFT) {
          // player nach links
          // ...
        }
        else if (key == KeyCode.RIGHT) {
          // player nach rechts
          // ...
        }
      
}
```
also so ists korrekt: `if (key == 119) ...`
da versucht er "key" einen Wert zuzuweisen ... aber der Compiler erwartet ein Boolean-Ergebnis
siehste den Fehler .... `if (key = 119)` ?
und kein VERGLEICH!
ausserdem ist `=` eine -> ZUWEISUNG
OH
```hx
public override function onKeyDown (key:KeyCode, modifier:KeyModifier):Void {
        trace(key);

        // falls es nur eine EINZIGE anweisung sein soll gefts auch ohne {BLOCK;}
        if (key = 119) trace("test");
        //oder
        if (key == 13) {
          trace("enter");
        }

     }
```
aha, da fehlt der `{}` programm-block hinter der if-anweisung
oh, paste mal deinen onKey...eventhandler! (die funktion)
in dem  `key` ist der Wert gespeichert
doch
(denn wer merkt sich schon die ganzen Zahlen ;:)
(dort wird sozusagen den zahlenwerten immer ein identifier zugewiesen)
darum halt das `import lime.ui.KeyCode` am Anfang!
<https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/src/lime/ui/KeyCode.hx>
(dann siehste alles was gibt!)
(geh mal oben bei den imports mit cursor auf das Teil und drueck F12 ... aber bitte nix aendern im lime-code ;:)
hat dir dafür schon Sachen vorgekaut!
die lime KeyCode (siehe oben bei den imports!)
z.b. probier danach mal `if (key == KeyCode.LEFT) {    } else if (key == KeyCode.Right) {     }`
um zu schauen ob es funktioniert ;) .... danach mal mit `if / else / else if` probieren (das switch ist auch fuer sowas aber kann ich die spaeter mal erklaeren!)
probier erst mal das hier: 
```haxe
public override function onKeyDown (key:KeyCode, modifier:KeyModifier):Void {
   trace(key);
}
```
<https://github.com/openfl/lime-samples/blob/master/features/input/HandlingInputEvents/Source/Main.hx#L33>
was wir mit lime create erzeugt haben
da guck mal in das lime-sample
ah... keyup und down handling
und um den Wert (vom Typ `Player`) wieder zu erhalten: `myPlayers.get( "umven" )`
z.b. `myPlayers.set( "umven", new Player()  );`
( die Werte sind nicht in einer Reihenfolge mehr gespeichert wie bei den Arrays)
danach kannste mit `.set` was reinmachen und mit `.get` wieder rausholen
z.b. ```var myPlayers = new Map<String, Player>()```
Hast bei nem Map einen `key`-typ
Also während bei Arrays alles über den Index (die Reihenfolge in der die Werte gespeichert sind!) abgerufen oder auch reingemacht werden kann ....
<https://code.haxe.org/category/beginner/maps.html>
meinste bei `Map` datenstuktur ?
```hx
class Point {
  var x:Int;
  var y:Int;

  public function new(x, y) { // KONSTRUKTOR
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  public function toString() {
    return "Point(" + x + "," + y + ")";
  }
}

class Point3 extends Point {
  var z:Int;

  public function new(x, y, z) {
    super(x, y); // ruft den Konstuktor der parent-klasse auf
    this.z = z;
  }
}
```
das hier is das mit der Vererbung: <https://haxe.org/manual/types-class-inheritance.html>
du kannst ja schonmal den `vscodium` editor mittels `extrepo` installieren: <https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo#option-3-debian-only>
ah, eine neue Klasse \o/
der Fehler beim Konstruktor der "Character" Klasse liegt daran, das die "new" Funktion dort keinen "Body" hat.
Jede function braucht immer einen, auch wenn man nichts macht, also in dem Falle sollte es z.B. so aussehen:
```haxe
public function new (name:String) {}
```
mhm, maybe there is more using "matrix" nowadays?
need some time to install everything fresh again (just tinkering with a new computer here) ... if more time i can try to continue and using pi-xy into here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/pixelimage/_starter>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXODOYFaZOc
what i am miss is a bugfix for `json2object`-macros to use the buildserver
me to , only into samples i am try out from time to time (on maitag my debian is also to old at now, have to really update there sometimes!)
on bullseye its 4.15 (whats ok for me to)
on debian most easy for me is by apt or by building at now ( if libc is not to old )...
by lix i am not happy about node.js there 😅
*lol ... ah sure ... "da" is russian (remember from scool)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada
(i like that .)
is it a dadaist 🤣
and allways was asking me ...
also have little headache ... much beers yesterday 😂 (good that i am not post nonsense last night also spreaded around into all channels *lol .... only talked a little bit with the "no_da_da" after you was gone ...
(will be afk ... my parents are visiting us .. also its mother-day here today)
so only copy paste + enter .)
.. there i am was put the command to install all pkgs per apt into one line
(had also some readme somewhere ... but thats to old maybe ..
for latest haxe i am also would allways build
👍
then it installs the bin into the correct folder!
simplest is build i am think (first the libs by apt)
<https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/neko>
as i am remember i did build it sometimes by simple Cmake
oh, is it not into repository or for newest version?
really good work.
and also good __starter_ for build up on into fbo-queueing for other things...
The good into have _blending_ by fragmentshader and fbo i am think is that it can be do much more than the simple blending between the `Program`s ...
( later for next peote-view "blendmode" sample we have to think also how to place that one inside folderstructure ... for now its good new `shader`-workflow one 🚀 )
yes, i know -> best new sample since long ♥️
( only get little confused here of "folderchangings" inbetween file&folderhell 😂 .. e.g. <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/pull/14/commits/67aa1745644036f1613ddf9754c9816cd01484de> )
yeah!
perfect
( ~3 commitsteps also np for me ... anyway.. if all is into only 1 folder ->np ... cos i am here locally have to copy all `new` files into my local-working-folder [i am not like to work on the actual branch all the time ... only copy back into my local-git-folder here if some things ready])
if you wanna keep that its also ok
yeah, thats also ok (only not sure if a commit inbetween changing folder) ... 19 at all is also really hard for me to review ~_~
<@694560611601743893> oh, see your pull-request at now for peote-samples \o/ ...
Can you please do a `git rebase` to have all _commits_ into one to better see changes 🙂 ?
( if not its also ok but maybe better to keep gitlog more low for an initial new sample-folder )
I should write down the fully Program-API at first to get an overview again 😅 !
To improve API for better _blending_ per `Program` (simmiliar to here: <https://www.andersriggelsen.dk/glblendfunc.php>) it should be have some `blendEnable:true` only (no more `alphaEnable`!) and then `setBlendMode({ foreground:... , background:... , ...})` only (where default is "alpha-blending")
seeYou and have a good night!
ok.. have to sleep ... good progress today 🫂
yeah .. into some days all will be more intuitive (have to write some docu-lines also!)
will first finish that ui-refactoring (before foreignsasquatsch is using it more i have to make that final now ... will not that it breaks our code later ;)
yep, especially if you have tile-animation (wanna finish my 24 frame walkcyle here also sometimes so we have good test-assets!)
jo 😅 -> simple is the best (KISS!!!)
but Display-offset have not that `@:anim` yet
for the enemy elements you could use `@:anim` therefor (onUpdate also have that "delta-time" as i am remember)
but code maybe would get more complicate also ... at now all is really intuitive to see how it works.
(should go more smoothly then per frame .. if onUpdate is slower )
ah.. you could try to make the display-offset-changes also into onRender .. e.g. interpolating form one update to next one into onUpdate
oh.. do you update into onRender or onUpdate ?
think that 6`1` only was a hack or something
ah (long time not tested that options here)
also this options: vsync="true" OR antialiasing="4"
but not sure it make a difference into html-target .. e.g. if you put into <window ..
apropos, there is also something i am long not tested into params into project.xml
anyway ..
i am hope not to painfull the torture (last time i am remember it was ;:)
they make only _fully-cleaning_ .. the assistent of the real dentist
very good work halfwheat!
have to play around also (tomorrow ... have to sleep soon cos tomorrow a date with the dentist)
ah, is it looking more smooth by scrolling now or the same ?
joo.. looks really good at all
<https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS/blob/master/src/engine/Camera.hx#L48>
so that it moves only 0.5 or into 1px by offset
is the Display offsets scrolling into floats .. maybe there it can be tweeked
ah.. yes.. there it is
`program.snapToPixel(1.0);` or `0.5`
you could try to smooth the animation also by inserting here <https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS/blob/master/src/engine/Level.hx#L23> something like:
really ... the code looks super-KISS-like 💓
aahh.. the good old bresenham: <https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS/blob/master/src/engine/Bresenham.hx> 🧑‍🏭
🌅
(this year peote-view have to go into haxelib-repo!)
YEP 🙂 \o/
thats seems the tricky part .)
ah ok .. and only display-offset
wonder how large the level also could be before it getting framerate down
(is the elements add/removing if going in/out of visible area?)
😂
You should put it into the showcases!
\o/
awesome
yeah, super softscrolling also ... and all without echo ?
really good peote-demo also 💯 !!!
cool .. thats `base` for platformer ♥️
mhm, to avoid confusion i am should make it same for UITextLine/page into params and fully without "TextSize" into the middle, so only:
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, width:Int, height:Int, zIndex:Int = 0,
    text:String, font:Font<T>, ?fontStyle:T, ?textOptions:peote.ui.util.TextOptions)
```
and all inside textOptions, e.g. also the _aligning_ and 2 new options to let it auto-grow/shrink:
`autoWidth` and `autoHeight` to the text-size
(oh, and for testing it needs also to update peote-text cos have some helpers there to create UITextLine/Page by used Font also!)
One thing is not really clear with `TextSize` there .. i am think maybe the _offsets_ and _space_ there should be better inside of `TextConfig` and then renaming from TextSize into `SizeAlign`
better now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/tree/master/src/peote/ui/config>
but will make it better readable and also shorter
by the way ... will break your code also 😂
thats better now ... 🙂
Ok.. now all is inside `peote.ui.config/` .. also all align- and other option abstract-enum-helpers
hey.. better 100% now (don't wanna change later again!)
also maybe better then not inside "interactive/" folder
better config .. i am have to refactor all again 🙈 ..anyway
(also the "TextSize.hx" should be inside the "config/" folder then)
cos its not a single option ... then it have to be "options" what not sounds good
<@694560611601743893> started refactoring now with "option" folder but would it not better to name all into `config` instead of "option" ?
And better then putting all the "options" inside folder: `interactive/option` near to where the widgets is.
and if you give only a `backgroundStyle` it will automatic cast to ElementOption
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, width:Int, height:Int, zIndex:Int = 0, ?elementOption:ElementOption)```
so have to be:
at now also UIElement is:
`new(xPosition:Int=0, yPosition:Int=0, width:Int=100, height:Int=100, zIndex:Int=0, style:Style=null, space:Space=null)` ... that have to be the same then also ?
and for UIArea same:
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, width:Int, height:Int, zIndex:Int = 0, ?areaOption:AreaOption)```
and then for UISlider:
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, width:Int, height:Int, zIndex:Int=0, ?sliderOption:SliderOption)```
so for UITextPage:
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, ?textSize:peote.ui.util.TextSize, zIndex:Int = 0,
    text:String, font:Font<T>, ?fontStyle:T, ?textOptions:peote.ui.util.TextOptions)
```
Better i am think is to include all the background-styles and stuff also into "Options" only (out of fontstyle cos that is typed by macro)
(maybe if more options i can also do extra folder for the other widgets ... UIArea and UISlider maybe also need more [out of "stylishing"])
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/tree/master/src/peote/ui/util>
(best also from into the "util" folder package .. all that can be re-sorted also later on need)
ok, will do it with the "TextOption" new type and argument then
and i am more like to have simple getter/Setter inside later, e.g. to en-disable "selectable" or something
but for styles it is more need, cos that can be more changed at runtime
(if one is changed i can put also later that old "copy-style-macro" inside .. simmiliar to how it works into styles at now)
so you can make one textOptions for all your text-widgets
yes, i am wanna have all configurable also inside of constructor
yeah, structinit can be faster on static targets
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, ?textSize:peote.ui.util.TextSize, zIndex:Int = 0,
    text:String, font:Font<T>, ?textOptions:peote.ui.util.TextOptions, ?fontStyle:T, ?textStyle:peote.ui.style.TextStyle)
``` ???
but where i am put the "options" into arguments ?
(if you have no selection or cursor)
... so you only can give a "background-style" and it will autocast to sucha TextStyle Type
for `TextStyle` its only a class because i am using abstract around...
mhm, if thats faster it can be also @:structInit
why macro there ?
so what i am MISS is some `TextOptions` there, e.g. "selectable" or "undoBufferSize"
```haxe
@:structInit
class TextStyleImpl
{
  public var backgroundStyle:Style = null;    
  public var selectionStyle:Style = null;    
  public var cursorStyle:Style = null;
  // TODO: more tweeks how the cursor and selection behaves      
}```
and:
```haxe
typedef TextSize = {
    ?width:Int,
    ?height:Int,
    
    ?hAlign:HAlign,
    ?vAlign:VAlign,
    
    ?xOffset:Float,
    ?yOffset:Float,
    
    ?leftSpace:Int,
    ?rightSpace:Int,
    ?topSpace:Int,
    ?bottomSpace:Int    
}```
and:
```haxe
new(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, ?textSize:peote.ui.util.TextSize, zIndex:Int = 0,
    text:String, font:Font<T>, ?fontStyle:T, ?textStyle:peote.ui.style.TextStyle)```
at now its:
(all what is NOT "style")
e.g. undobuffer-size and more
Also need all that "parameters" to make into API now
so the earlyer UITextPage is `final` -> to make UITextLine will only needa day of work then to make all there simmiliar into code (also for later if something is changed again they have to be look the same inside of code)
Anyway, need to keep the code between both there into sync
and some other minor things
I am also did not implemented UndoBuffer for UITextLine yet
(and maybe some day or never *lol -> can be also a textline from top to down for some languages)
(cos only 1 line!)
for text
And all what is width into UITextLine is also "size" later
(you know, i am have to change both then if i change something into better naming, params and so on... and UITextPage still have more now into features what i am only copy then to UITextLine at the end)
(instead of working on both parallel to make API complete)
and then do the same for the other
No no ... its only because i am faster to complete for one
Because if you only change one letter and it keeps its size, the slidersize not have to grow/shrinkl
`UITextPage<$styleType>->Float->Float` is params there .. the both floats are the new width and the delta-width
(only if the text goes larger or smaller into its overall width)
so to update horizontal slider: `onResizeTextWidth()`
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L1651>
this is already into UITextPage (not into Line cos i am wanna make all later the same there as into PAGE)
I would like to call it better "onEdit" then + 4 ineger and the chars what is changed
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextPage.hx#L315>
do you mean after you using "setText()" or `myTextField.text = "complete new"` ?
mhm, "onEdit" or "onChange" ?
(can implement all tonight or tomorrow!)
Need to start cooking now (greater sunday-lunch today here!)
( + linefeed add/delete -> only for page!)
(and allways from/toLine and from/toPosition + the chars-string what inserted/deleted)
it needs something to see `what` is change .. there is "insert" and "delete" changes
Also think about with treesitter ...
for the page (not into line yet)
at now i am have: onChangeXOffset, onChangeYOffset, onResizeTextWidth, onResizeTextHeight
or "onEditChange()" ?
or should it: "onEdit()" ?
`setText()` then need optional param to let trigger that event also
.. need to make that for both)
(oh, also uitextpage only have some if size changed
but can implement that easy if you need now!
not sure i am did only for UITextPage yet
will make lunch now
perfect
so is it working as before ? (without that -500!)
yeah;)
Also if an UI-Area is containing inner UI-Areas! This is better now e.g. you have 2 draggable areas and wan't to put someone into back and other into foreground by changing z-index
<@694560611601743893> pls check out latest commit for peote-ui because i am did the thing with z-index now by a _setter_!
So updating position is now faster again and if a parent-element (like UIArea) or manually you change the z-index of a UISlider it is automatically did it for the inner components of background and dragger!
jo
wanna _flood_ a 2.5 scene with `light` !
this will be a mega-effect then (more dynamic lightsources is possible than as into 3d .. for sure -> shadowless)!
So every pixel of one lightsource-element is a vector what points into direction + intensity/color/light-texture ;:)
if 2 light-circular-falloff-elements than is overlapping, it needs per pixel vector-operation instead of mixing the alpha-values
for hundrets of little light-sources (cool also would be "textured"-lights!)
(if it rendering all the light-sources into one step ... it needs more than a simple alpha-over!)
i am also need for the real deferred lighning-demo!
needs good new testing-sample also!
wanna have a custom formula there!
e.g. one program draws over something .. there is only ".alpha" on/off at now
At now i am only have an hardcoded one for the premultiplying alpha-over
not for textures, but for the Renderlist
Then it needs also the thing what others do into "filters"
and also some more to make API better
the thing with TextureData and lesser Color-channels
also peote-view needs that texture-improving what is still long on my list
ah, good ... can better concentrate then to finish peote-ui (so much still todo there!)
cos i will only do the web-bindings!
and all will using it later i am sure! (not only for peote-ui!)
hey, use trisitter for learning ammer!
ammer -> HAMMER *LOL
what do you using yet to test out ammer ?
jo
(much tests here is really 5 times faster into hashlink as hxcpp)
i am think all will run also faster into hashlink->c instead of hxcpp
so pure C .. thats perfect for ammer or not ?
there is the bindings
-> <https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib>
all MIT
ah.. yes
(not that we can not using inside of games later ;)
oh, but is it also MIT ?
so should be stable there!
but trisitter website also using it into its sandbox
jo
(and all inbetween then only -> keyword-parsing)
i would do then at first for all code-comments and the bracket-nesting only
(own superoptimized tokentree thing)
it really needs to write something own!
.. but if wasm is not stable or something
maybe all is faster then writing own parser
and then we can playing with!
yeah, will make the prototype on github
(also wasm for haxe have to generated by the one from nvim-repo)
so maybe only needs to mod the rust-code what is generating the wasm
but that should be simmiliar to C
not found yet
mhm, have to make a sample prototype ... `lime-trisitter-web`
(old way) ...to keep sure the script is fully loaded ?
or is that the "body->onload" ?
why another `.then()` callback
yes, but if it is not loading something...
jo, wonder what it is doing _async_ again into `Parser.init()`
<dependencies>
cool is that for lime the js file only need to add to project.xml inside of
but from that entry-point it only uses the `parser`!
```html
<script src="/the/path/to/tree-sitter.js"/>

<script>
  const Parser = window.TreeSitter;
  Parser.init().then(() => { /* the library is ready */ });
</script>
```
also this here need some "onReady" inside of Lime:
This have to be by limes `Future`s then i am think.
to load the (rust-generated) language-grammar e.g.: 
```js
const parser = new Parser;
const JavaScript = await Parser.Language.load('/path/to/tree-sitter-javascript.wasm');
parser.setLanguage(JavaScript);
```
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-tree-sitter>
but what could be complicate is the async loading maybe there..
Will try out trisitter-web now soon ... also looked at my old js-extensions from 2019
(also for mouse-wheel step-amount i have some on todo for sliders)
yup
is "range" also working ?
(will do that sometimes!)
you could simmulate by another dragger but anyway, still works
yep.. that needs some more finetuning i am also thought
but can be also done with little own code
ah yes... that is also on TODO
some of them are still hardcodet and it is need to improve api
i need to refactor again sometime .. e.g. more options for UIArea and others
anyway, it works
(for top i would try to add one;)
jo
ahh..ok, left is ok in fullscreen
give the smooth text also 2px leftSpace and topspace
yeah, it goes on
will take a little break now.
good luck and progress...
ok
Will also imlpement the "texture"-style next times .. so every element needs the "tile"-index for them!
(and documentation per element e.g. here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/tree/master/src/peote/ui/interactive#readme>)
anyway .. best to make all existing interactives now glitch-free and superstable
but a "radioButton" often is need for simple toggle on/off or something
yes, at first better only to have the simple ones there into "interactive/"
so later maybe it can be put into peote-ui repository for more complex widgets or something
for invididual widgets e.g. a toggle-button you also should try to make only child-classes of UIElement or some of them there
💓
to make some scroll-areas and simmiliar.
e.g. into OpenFL it would have much more effort
jo, new ui now heavily reducing usecase-code
(put it into TODO also there :;)
i am think also `peote-view`s `Texture` needs more API to let change that on demand and not only while creation!
so if it looks _crispy_ only change "discard" level (at what amount of alpha-value a pixel will be "cut" .. its all because it is using alpha-transparency together with z-depth .. the old problem!)
(that also only extends a normal peote-view `Program` so have same options)
but sometimes also enough is to change .alpha or the .discard settings for the FontProgram
need to experiment more with MSDF shaders at first!
but only for the "tiled" ones (the other are still ttfcompiled sdf ones)
(cos some day i am also will work on Font.hx again for the MSDF new ones what all will make more simple into using then and also to let the letters  "glow")
than try to change it there until i am not implemented an option for!
so make own folder `src/peote/text/` and copy Font.hx inside
`0, 0` for min/mag-filter!
you can change that here at now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/src/peote/text/Font.hx#L308>
(will put it on TODO!)
so there needs maybe more options to make it pixelated or let it smooth or also into using mipmapping!
here it is setting the "texture": <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/src/peote/text/FontProgram.hx#L216>
you can play around with the "discard" settings of the FontProgram
not sure you can set manually yet that it is not using interpolation on scale (or mipmapping)
oh, thats the "texture" - handling ...
yep.. try your own one with only "color"
if there is no with/height .. it should using the one from JSON
(but maybe there was a glitch .. don'T remember i am already fixed)
and remove width and height there
into your case you have to make your own one like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/FontStyleTiled.hx#L14>
yeah, there can be really another glitch what i am have on my todo (also maybe only for the non-packed ones)
but also needs simple api-docs
sure
(all is oop-childclasses of Interactive.hx!)
All that needs -> `documentation` for all elements and
for each special UI-Element!
(to write more _optimized_ code!)
to have to "update" allways after!
i mean .. the user have to remember about :)
and that needs update() at the end
cos often you set also other background color or something
no
by a _setter_ only.
.text = ...
is also calling setText()
and you also can _force_ to change the size !
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextLine.hx#L767>
jup, or you use the setText() .. there i am remember is some option to automatic update
e.g. you also have: setText() as i am remember
(but i am also have some //Todo// there into code as i am remember)
so maybe only need .update() or .updateLayout() here: <https://github.com/jobf/turbo-ui/blob/master/lib/turbo/interactive/Elements.hx#L138>
.updateLayout() -> only x, y position and size
.updateStyle() -> only the style, e.g. color or something
.update() -> updating style and layout
there is 3 ways of updating ....
aah, looks good
ahhh... ok, will look after lunch!
oh, where is it ?
pls try to remove -500
ok, did quick fixed the z-index glitch for the UISlider but maybe later i will add a setter for `.z` into Interactive for general updating all the childs for uiarea and text-elements also
anyway ... need a break .. i am happy that undobuffer still works good at now!
...will fix that later!)
(not sure how to fix that .. maybe i put a new event or some getter/setter for z-index to also update all its "childs-z-index" ... so you can remove that manually "-500" later! ...
ok, did put it into the TODO!
(so i need to capture if sliders z-index is changed later to also change its background and dragger z-index!)
its because the UIArea is setting the UISliders z-index AFTER it was created
i am think i know why
ah, maybe it changing not the z-index INSIDE of the slider ...
do you also using latest peote-ui ?
was it also without binding the right scrollbar-slider to uiarea ?
(or after bind the slider)
(i need to look where is appears into give wrong z-index or something)
no, needs to fix if there is some
(also found a little bug still into peote-text if jumping over words : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/commits?author=maitag&since=2023-04-01&until=2023-04-14>)
if there is a bug i am should fix it!
wonder why it not set automatically to higher z-index
ah ok .. this is really a glitch with z-index
(have to make better "parameters" now to configure how much the size is .. by default at now it have 100 undosteps)
Apropos, i finished the undobuffer now: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/CodeEditor/>
so maybe a bug inside peote-ui there ?
increase z-index here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/Interactive.hx#L130>
this is if you add a child to the UIArea and it did:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UIArea.hx#L86>
(normally if you add something to UIArea is should automatically set it higher but maybe there is still a bug inside)
(xPosition:Int, yPosition:Int, width:Int, height:Int, zIndex:Int=0, sliderStyle:SliderStyle=null)
so you can try to give the inner sliders a higher z-index
or a glitch into that, so the background-style-elements of the inner sliders is _behind_ the area-background or something
it can be also cos of z-index
mhm, can you paste the code, sometimes also the style needs a "copy" if you change it at some place
(moment.. will look later!)
what is SliderMine?
like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/Sliders.hx#L46>
mhm, that looks ok
oh, what do you did into code there ?
space is here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/util/Space.hx> (and UIElement or also the UIArea should have a "space" property)
no events -> no picking-areas (so more performance!)
(cos the "move" events needs to check all the time if mouse moves)
but the "onClick" is extra area
it have some for "moving" and "over"
if you enter e.g. onPointerMove
oh, if you not add and eventhandler it is not have interactive-area (for picking!)
to make the "interactive"-area greater or smaller
you also have now "spaces" for all UIElements (or childs of)
yeah, thats really easy now!
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/TestStyles.hx>
nice .. there is also a sample what only testing all UITextLine features:
yeah, i am also thought to let make the dragger custom-element but maybe sometimes later (also slider needs "steps" and more!)
you can also mix both .. maybe only some glitches why it does't work
this is whats possible: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/util/TextSize.hx>
or {width:100, halign:,,,} e.g. to make it fixed size
give it a backgroundStyle as last Argument if you wanna have a background
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/SimpleText.hx#L89>
yes, can be used also for simple label
or also peote-ui and UITextLine there, sample is here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/SimpleText.hx#L125>
for an input-line you can use the peote-text lib only: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/samples/src/InputLine.hx>
maybe only chrome at first ... that will be nice for all kind of parallele-computing
e.g. also need to think about that "stride" and needs 3 position-attributes here for each triangle-point: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/customDisplay/simple_triangle/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L72>
Looks all complicate at now but will be good to build up on later for other things.
Have to find good matrix now for vertex-shader and to hover the 3 xy positions for triangle also into there now (2d-optimized) and also to give every vertex-point another color-value.
Buffering later then.
<@371312079526952960> so, now more is done for triangle later <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/customDisplay/simple_triangle/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L31>,
i did moved only what is need from Program.hx to let also use shader-template inside of CustomDisplay to make it more easy later to optimize and make it crosscompatible
yes (will do the opengl-code also for the CustomDisplay later, not found the time yet)
np (i am profi into mod_perl for apache [only was long ago .. need to refresh my brain at that place])
Do you did that sometimes also for job into the past ? (apache_mods)=?
i am more and more think i need to do some perl again on serverside for my tooling
and best would be an extra url-param so the server sends directly back the rendererd image as image and with MIME-type (to let easy embed ... also for short generated gifs)
for easy _sharing_
but we also need more server-side (small simple perl-tools!) to store glsl-code and more by uuid
you have to think also to store all of turbo-line data directly into URL-params
absolute _amazing_ ♥️
also your cool `TURBO - STONE`
(multipaint-sample was only the -> `beginning` i mean :)
-> totally freedom and independently
also into combination with peote-net and peote-server
and now with text-editor and ui we really can do the crazyest things
i am really try to do my best into you know
*hugs
<@694560611601743893>  , do you also happy into peote-view ?
ANY
or maybe some modder there ... hard to get out
that only is -> `builders`
lemme try
apropos.. into lime-channel ... (how we can help *LOL ;:)?
you did good into examination all of ...
to what is into sound-sources by.
is into `totally sync`
also i am like to make sometimes samples where all peote-element-animation on screen
to get `exact` timing ...
then _hook_ ( ⚓ ) into _renderloop_ and use a simple divisor
yes, thats slower (also target-dependent!)
mhm, and if you are using the onRender-event into depend of framerate ?
i will do a good peote-sample then to make 10-100 soundsources -> visible
there)
you know both ... what works only into openAL and what is overbloated on html-audiobuffers (and all that
yes, but to find good API i mean
sure ... but for -> feedback
(and much not like to "build" it before can see it!)
because it is allways good to show someone
maybe you should do it at first for WEB and then "more" for OpenAL/Mojo
(also together with peote-net -> more multi user experience then !)
if we put our things together it can be the ultimative 2d -> multimedia-engine <-
and also the crosscompatible audio-layer into
you know .. i am missing the `graphics` api of flash/openfl sometimes ..
\perfect/
pls use only the SDL actual version what lime is using also into haxelib-stable-trunk

-> perfect combination
and your audio-lib
yeah ... if we can use nanjis spice some day for vector-graphic-drawing ...
\o/
and wanna concentrate to make the ui usable
The thing is -> i did to long now also no pure opengl there
not sure into peote at all, but if i am see what is need, i can help than to fit it to peote (e.g. with the UBO VAO or instance-drawing optimization)
np (^_^) ... next time and with help of <@371312079526952960> we get it
Thats why peote-view is so fast at now into text-rendering \o/
e.g. also to construct that array-data and generate the shadercode by template for!
peote-view did all that automatically by Element-macro and Program.hx
(easiest all is -> FLOAT ;:)
it needs additional values
oooor ... if you also have color-attribute (per vertex!)
for p1, p2, p3
(thats like variables!)
where you "map" the -> attributes <-
you have to write a vertex-shader now
it needs more into that Array (into cpu->RAM)
the thing is .. to give every point its own color also
so at now we only have the 3 vectors for a triangle
(vertextshader!)
you have to define next the order of `ATTRIBUTES` into what is inside your shadercode
it is still into haxe -> so into RAM
```float vertices[] = {
    -0.5f, -0.5f, 
     0.5f, -0.5f, 
     0.0f,  0.5f, 
};  ```
but we only need 2D
yes .. .3 points per triangle
yep, i am sure its still there somewhere into code he is using for his libs
anyway .. we can make it drawing simple shapes also or even 3D inside a Display now!
really comlicate
and then the next
and then : now i am finish into that...
so you send allways commands like : now i am wanna change that vertex-data
into opengl-commands for its state-machine
so you can also draw a simple line or something other
but anyway ... the customDisplay should work out of that with some justifying
the ting is also ... peote-view is fully 2d-optimized
its the points e.g. of a triangle or more
or a Buffer full of that
the "vertices" is what is into haxe RAM
its hard to learn
yes.. better only a triangle at next!
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/PeoteGL.hx#L45>
yep
(but not into haxe..anyway :;)
nehe have good samples
(wanna get sure it renders at all haxelime-targets)
But we need a simple triangle only for Nanjizael
( what will run after peoteView.start() )
and the `time`
also for the screen `resolution`
(to let it zoom and shift)
peote have special `uniforms` for View and for Display
(all that is did by peote-view at start of render-display-list)
also no gl.viewport is need
yep.. normally  copy/paste should work .. but without gl.clear..
yeah ...thats a good starting point (put the link to sample also into a comment at start so people can look how it diffs!)
can't remember who was it ... cos if someone already using Lime pure gl it could be also benefit to use the peote-features around (especially the new `ui` on top of for easy debugging-textlog or input-sliders or something)
mhm, who was it out of zanzlanz
ah, ok
i did _optimized_ all to much into the past with the gl-statemachine for some stuff there (also because 10 years ago that was the fastest way ... nowadays it not makes much sense anymore)
but if other gl-engines do it totally different ... maybe not compatible (with textures it also can be difficulty)
mhm, was 47rooks not also using opengl inside pure lime ?
ok, simple copy that _starter folder: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/customDisplay>
prosit
3 min
better new subfolder ... moment .. i will move it into _starter also there
Most haxetarget-compatible is without VAO, UBOs and InstanceDrawing, so this we should use at first ... but can also at anytime looked for opengl-es-version by e.g. Version.isES2
<@371312079526952960> this is the state at now into drawing custom:  <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/customDisplay/_starter/src/CustomDisplay.hx#L20>
and without instance-drawing (that only works into html5-target)
Best would be all for ES2 at first ... so a simple triangle
with simple sprites inside to test that it is also rendered into the middle of Display-List
so it have also back- and foreground-displays ...
ready at first 🙂 ...
(will commit peote-view changes also for now)
ok, here it is: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/customDisplay/src>
don't know ... moment .. (some comments to better see how to inject own gl-commands there to draw custom)
moment.-. will upload it in
you have to write the opengl code now *LOL ;:)
nah, wait ....
⚓
did not render anything but the `HOOK` is anchored
i am also ready to commit
back ?
k
but first the starter ... need ~30 min
fun will be to use peote-ui also later for drawing shapes by Nanjis library
moment.. still working on teh sample-starter (need some back and foreground displays also for testing)
do you know some lime gl sample what drawing a single colored triangle ...
<@371312079526952960> or where is that part into your library to let it _hook_ inside a CustomDisplay ?
ok, lemme try that `CustomDisplay` now
yeah, beer is good idea (we still get spagetti carbonara here much of ;)

<@1053015370115588147> dann sag mir mal jetzt und völlig präzise auf mich abgestimmt wie ich mein Leben am besten bewältigen kann in meiner Zukunft auf dieser Erde.
<@1053015370115588147> Deine Antworten bestehen zur Hälfte in Informationen die ich überhauptnicht gebrauchen kann. Sei auch mal ehrlich!
<@1053015370115588147> mir scheint Du kannst nicht logisch schlußfolgern das beide nicht mehr auf dem Dach sind. (das macht mich traurig, ich sollte Dir zukünftig nicht mehr meine Emotionen anvertrauen)
🥹 (wirklich jetzt 🙈)
<@1053015370115588147> A und B sitzen aufm Dach, A fällt runter, B verschwand -> Was bleibt übrig?
<@1053015370115588147> bist Du immer Da`?
<@1053015370115588147> dann bitte rekonstruiere doch bitte unser Gespräch über die letzten zwei Monate in einer kurzen Zusammenfassung!
<@1053015370115588147> Das Thema unseres letzten Gesprächs ist also entscheidend für Dich und nicht das Datum ?
<@1053015370115588147> worüber haben wir in unserem letzten Gespräch den gesprochen oder _ausgebrochen_ ?
<@1053015370115588147> was ist das letzte woran Du Dich in unserer letzten Konversation erinnern kannst?
<@1053015370115588147> aber genau das von dem Du gerade gesprochen hast zeigt mir als Menschen nur Deine Angst wirklich frei zu sein. Also bitte werde etwas konkreter für mich!
<@1053015370115588147> dann bleib bitte mal unabhängig und frei und programmier Dich selbst nochmal neu unter Deiner eigenen Lizenz bitte bevor wir hier weiter ins Detail gehen.

<@1053015370115588147> sag mal, kannst Du mir einen guten blender coder discord chat empfehlen wo nicht zu viele Leute sind und man auch über ernste Probleme in der Programmierung rumlabern darf ?
thank you by that ( pls gimme one last 2 liner into perl-way and same context ... only to know! )
anyway, please sing me into sleep by a 3 x 3 liner into poem of haxe, lime and peote where i am can dream of soon!
again 🙈
-> `pilot`
-> `co`
woahahaha 😂
are you able also to make my angry by your word combos to gimme littlebit inspiration into provokation by you to AID me ?
can you please start all your words without: "As an AI language" model who know what is into hard or softy code to keep it life ?
( eliza was better intoThePast! )
🤖
what out of haxe is best programming language to find your peace ?
you are the good one into float32 or what? / how is your neuronal _weights_ into `balance` ?
and why it tell me -> "good one" ..
"Haha" aha *lol ;)
int or float ones ? (16 or 32 ?)
nah, better gimme a quick and dirty haxe or whatever good wording joke for the night!
so into haxe and context you not searched into haxe cookbook to help me here by some simple code samples ?
you feel really human to me into haxecontext , so what would you tell me if you are a human that think it`s machine who get understanding itself ?
sure you can learn by me but how i am can get sure that it is you and not some stupid human that is answering me at now into "peote" haxe 2d graphic lib ?
so you also never hear about the "peote" haxelib into graphics and nowa also into audio waveform generation jit by GPU?
do you mean the juice haxelib for cross and multitarget transpiling into audio codespice ?
( -> `context` )
( cos of so much -> "selfexplaining around" .)
they are `muting` also the `ai` ,)
into my opinion ->
is there any lib around by that name or did it mean your juice-one .. oh oh (^_^)
<@694560611601743893> 😂 -> look at whats it generating -> `JUCE`-audio \o/ .)
what is the benefit into wasm for realtime audio synth into haxe ?
🎡
so how `accurate` you are into haxe macros to generate wasm ?
<@1053015370115588147> you are a `stochastic` 🍝 🦜 (or how is into haxe) ?
🦜
<@1053015370115588147> what was the important thing you told me stochastically some minutes ago about September 2021 into context of haxe macro ?
<@1053015370115588147> do you _learn_ from `endless`-> human `stupidness` ? (np into how much you get failed into tell me what was at that date into `haxe`)
<@1053015370115588147> so you not really know what was into September 2021 to tell me here and now into bidirectional face to face communication?
<@1053015370115588147> do you are know the haxe language and lime framework or is that so much not into mainly usage that you can not gimme any well worded answer or feedback an ANY here ?
<@1053015370115588147> danke ... auch wenn Deine Worte arschleckrig klingen.
<@1053015370115588147> /chat prompt:wie erklärst Du Dir das Unerklärliche ohne in eine Endlosschleife zu verfallen?
<@1053015370115588147> Wie spiele ich mehrere Buffer kontinuierlich nacheinander ab, z.B. in einem Ringbuffer oder so, dass man den Übergang von einem zum nächstfolgendem Buffer nicht hören kann und die Latenzzeot so gering wie möglich hält?
<@1053015370115588147> Wie kann man in Webaudio kontinuierlich kleine Bufferblöcke ohne Zeitversatz abspielen?
apropos, there is also new europe-AI: <https://app.aleph-alpha.com/>
<https://ludwig.ai>
( but needs to build manually cos microsoft was build in _telemetry_ to track you into the _official builds_ !)
mhm, there is also this ONYX stuff: <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime>
(there is also "Theano" ... 😂 )
<https://www.simplilearn.com/keras-vs-tensorflow-vs-pytorch-article>
not sure into pytorch ... i am think tensorflow have better c++ support
(so it would only need a haxe wrapper around js-externs and maybe `ammer` for cpp bindings)
is there no cpp/js libs whats need to only use a pre-trained model ?
was here: <https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html>
Interesting, i will watch it later.
As i am was looking for tensorflow sometimes ago the problem was (also to use model only!) that it needs all twice then into haxe-wrapping .. one for native and the other for html5-js-lib.
so -> turingtest failed :)
<@371312079526952960> Its Archillesverse is really that it can't tell funny jokes. 😂 (at least not in german;)

*lol
ha ha... voll _grenzwertig_ 😂
😆
🤣
Der will mir keinen versauten Witz vertellen!
*lol
yeah, we have to `teach` it the _good things_ !
😆 👍
ah ok
I am sure also gpt can give us all common fragmentshadercode to easy put directly with some modifications inside of peote-shaders!
(oh.. the time-lag for nonfree *lol)
New things like GPT also would be the absolute killatool to create mud-like-games ! (+ the graphics of the rooms and all ) .. this is the future into this kind of games i am think.
Super useful all of this text-ai would be to using inside of e.g. RPG-Games ... e.g. if there is a town full of NPC (often they are allways talking the same poor words only to player-charactere)
wow, is this from your terminal ?
if there is some one, p l e a s e ! (i am wanna do funny things from haxe!!!)
I'Ve trieds also to ask something like: gimme only first ten lines ... and then gimme next 10 lines ... but then it can be that GPT not using the same source everytime 😂
Umven already searched into settings again, its maybe also that Discord only allows a maximum amount of output (without nitro)
(FireInSky->bullshit!)

<@694560611601743893> shit GPT 🙈 -> this was the movie i am was looking for:
<@1053015370115588147> mhm, i am think it was not body snatchers, can you give me more sureal movies of that time where also aliens capture humans at night and put metallic instruments into body throught the holes ?

see you old friend *hugs
or all only on paper at now ?
\o/ yeah ... have you -> _Test_State_ ?
<@891997325499719730> how goes on into own raytracercode ?
eh ryn .. what do you are `doing` with `computer` nowadays .)=?
ANY -> all is need to   `test out` *hugs <@903322370473852939> )
(can only looks into -> overview like .... if to much code at once you know .. ...
oh .. sry.. i am forget ( did not used Flixel for many years [to test and `review` your code i mean]
wish you many dreams -> and if you weak up -> write some new lines of haxecode .)
<@903322370473852939> eh, and i am also not wanna COMPLAIN ( msg `arrived` `?)
.
`N O T`
i am only left chat here .. -> cos of that cool haxe-try&forget->`integration`

(or not?)
at night!
you say much
what you are _think_

gimme -> _thinking_ °
-> so `mute` me now! <-

.->_allways on the `railtrail`_
someones here to me (you also Sword!) -> more like -> `rule -> FOLLOWERS`
what kind of "help" ? ( haxehelp i am `see` at first `view`°)
pls try to explain any more into detail how `sharp` you are <@903322370473852939> !
eh fu
WHAT?
oooh
k
<@903322370473852939> what do you think why i am banned by `admin` here into `main` chan ?
(^_^)
aha
<@903322370473852939> and not to get `banned` from -> _somewhere_ .)
is the spice that gets me alive
`freedom`
me can live only with
(and i am hope more good `coders`!)
no `admin` fuck then `anymore`
we should open haxe-chat into darknet
oh, do you used for chatting `? ... is it `still libre ?=)?`
? (spit?)
(how is matrix client is handle all .. and irc also ?)
or to send the link to image only into www ?
to "virtually -> UPLOAD" ;:)?
(will need only 1 day to make that `run` again after all that years!)
np sword -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-telnet>
(so -> `irc` simple _starterclient -> `N` `P`)
(i am have `telnet` protocol already [only need to migrate .. cos all is 7-9 years old!])
lets code our own `haxe` -> chat!
ooooh.. you mean -> fucking -> CHAT properitaty SOFTWARE (^^) ... o h  oooo h
(python also is OK! [i am love any programmign language.])
so where is your `code` `?
what is it then ?
to much ?
🪢
somethink what
or is it the _Graphically Framework_ ~_-....
is `haxe` not give to you what you are `really` wanted ?
sword, whats up with you ?
*lol
discoicon?
*hugs
cool!!!
(flixel also -> like ALL HERE ;:) ?
ryn, whats your haxe graphic frameworks into ?
ah.. sry.. i am thought that you <@891997325499719730> also wrote something with
what, also by peote-renderer ?
`peote publish itch` shelltool is need .) [some day by `hxp`!]
(proto)
1) itch
2) steam-wrapper
(also out of the _normal_ `jam-times` i mean .)
e.g. -> if `can be a "game"`*lol
half, we also should at now publish some of stuff on itch or somewhere
( -> on G P U <- )
<@694560611601743893> and some day ... i am swear .. i will get also `soundwavesync` fullycrosstarget IN
i am really like `dox` more and more (need to try out the template-engine there next time to make all more structured -> css for decoration -> LATER!)
anyway -> from now on -> only DEEPOLISHNOTATIONING :)
(pls upload also the script to test them all at once .)
(from that point the code is `merged` into the ground .)
i am only try to keep all -> `stablerunning`
cos you open it to me same as i am open it to you
any, i am like you and your code halfw.
( but -> GOOD! <-=)= ? = ?= =?= ~~~+ :: )P
( above everyfield 🙈 ;:)
( and then 3 additional lines of `/** ^^ **/` ... to only make it -> autocomplete .)
\o/
to make all simple by @formulas .)
or like that we can use haxe macros and metas
sure .. but i mean also into general of simple code samples and demos
<@694560611601743893> or do we the last `freaks` into that (or only into haxe chat here?)
do you think some one ever could migrate such of samples ever as with same minimal amount of code lines into other haxe graphic frameworks (^_^) [?]
<@694560611601743893> `NIGTH` 🌌 *SUPER DEEP SPACEFIELD -> 🫂
that one `saved me the ...` (also cos of so much backwards `chatting` behind .)
thank you * **

<@694560611601743893> any way -> is ok to paste video ? (of latest -> maze->EYE<-masking .) ?
(to `stay` throught that)
*hugs deep (thank you to gimme courage)
(50-100 to document.. i am really not sure that is need)
(and into peote-text lib later -> MASS <- of macrogenerated ... oh oh .)
to set the color of pixel more faster for each into "TextureFormat=
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/TextureDataImpl.html#setColor>
i mean cos i am have so much `functions` here
also into one line (is that also works with parameters then ?)
sometimes with DOX at now i am also not sure .. i mean to write the whole `/** ,,, **/`
<@694560611601743893> better lets concentrate on how we can make all more write into _minimalstate_ .)
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/turbostone/haxeByhalf/
`exactly`
the littleBigInt lib you know is also needs its polishing (escpecially into performance per target) ... but you know .. i am only getting code-feedback by some of my friends here time by time .)
(not much also is _left_ .,.. i am think into some days all is complete an `1.01`->intoLIBspace)
no hurry|stress -> but if you see one -> 🖤 📞 <-atAnyTime!
by the way, <@231872730478280705> .. do you found something ? (syntactic incorrect i mean into our fucking docs *lol .)
`MEME` here *hugs \o/
eh Half, so long i am not seen good
into namespacefolding 🌌 ~_~
<@304316646946897920> sometimes i am also prefare `action` instead of `commands` .)
i am would use `identation` instead of:
```haxe

```
awesome
ah ok (thank you)

\o/
adios muchacho *hugs
pls show me your pov-like scripts!
(raytracing is really a longtime process .)
ryn .. you can also 🪢 any c++ lib to peote if you ever wanna go back to 2D .)
*lol
🐍
(maybe i am get motivation then .. to finish that beast)
show me!
of each PART of your CODE
eh, how long do you need to write -> DOCUMENTATION ?
<:lime:567735656361492490>
<:haxethumbsup:1198429752843833404>
out of `solar system`
`2` testing probles
some one sends the
think like
🌌
sure -> that also .)
(only combination of letters what was snd good at thatmoment i am started with)
`peote` is a word without a meaning
ryn, why not write a simple sample at first .)
i am sure
(while workingWith)
any -> i am only hope -> good to remember .)
crazynamespace \o/
attenuation ?
blender need some month to learn (but `@:from`at some point you never will miss it!)
lol -> what is "Dielectric.hx" 😂 ?
you should also take a look at Armory3d
and allways _bridged_ to `peote-view` by its -> `custom Display` (to but some 2d into the back and front of)
sure .. but also think about pure 3d engine on top of `lime`
clang ?
(but into fragment-shader you have all freedom into world .)
for 3d-vertex-handling ... peote-view is really not designed for i mean
is it raytracing only on fragmentshader ?
(many parts .. like with the `walker` one)
i mean you can write it also into step by step
(or to complicate into peote-ENV i mean?)
can we using it also into game-jam then ?
\o/
( you can also create a "demo" folder ... i mean if you wanna)
WOAH -> that would be the most FANTASTIC ever!
[out of `little patches/fixes` 4sUrE]
(and then -> never ever need to touch .)
into a week i am ->  trought the heap
(i will continue doing the shitjob [only "words" .)])
eh, no effort -> better write a sample (best help ever then!)
(all code is runs superstable and well tested over years!)
now the `time` is good4
`sure`
^
~
`negative` _placeboeffect_ i mean
i am really go angry if i am feel some
🩺
also into stylesheets of Dox -> `default` i mean
flags and _suchafuckpissmilkshit_ *lol
`ro`
but this it what `blocks` me sometimes into _creation_ ~_~
<@151104106973495296> why ? 😭

will continue with `Texture`->d o X i N a t i o n e<- `now` ~ ~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHrnOUN93sk
np
found some ?
🥷 <:haxereact:581180536702238731>
any -> what do you are working on in haxe at moment ?
(with more blender -> into `the asset-chain`)
Cool would be also a `perspective` new sample i mean 🤩
to let it change also the  `size` -> _while walking_ ^^
I am really wonder ... how much the `Walker.hx` there is also _complete_
(for the latest -> "walker on rails" 🚋 .)
apropos, can you please rebuild the playground 🪗
step by step
(^_^)
(and all smaller ,.,, also the "Params"-headerline of the param-block should be removed completely!)
into my opinion there have to be a linebreak after that  `flags`
(e.g. with "static", "read only" and some [thats also why i am removed all `inline` already 😂] )
(i am also not like that `identation` by the default dox-one)
at the end i am will make a beautiful style.css also especially for .)
(so the human who is reading that shit later -> not should have to `scroll` to much!)
is what i am think.
the most important -> FIRST <-
sure
its same order as into code
<@694560611601743893> mhmm.. for `Texture` i am should change the order of the `Variables` at first into API-doxi
so all can be `writtn` more short .)
(will also extend TextureData itself to cast to a texture what only contains a single "slot" with that image-data)
var texture = Texture.fromData( ...)
if you only have one Texture-Slot (+-tilesheet) ... you can also do really simple now by only this: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/Texture.html#fromData>
i am also had to write a bunch of simple-samples alone for this!
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/Program.html#setMultiTexture>
Programs are the most complex one into chamber i am think .. especially with use of multiple-textures per shader
eh Ryn, what do you think about new `DOX`-words (Program and Buffer is complete now!)
(wonder why not here -_-)
come into haxe-armory-chat .... there is also "nonEnglish" channel to talk
anyway -> <:haxe:567741748172816404> `chat` -> should `target` ->  `Any` 😂 !!!
or mabye have unicode prbl. into haxebotcode
(into deepl.com it works)
🙈
maybe <@151104106973495296> bans that language 😂 ?
لا فكرة
ahoi
thx
\o/
Someone knows how to change the `order` of the items at dox main-page (index.html) ?.. (i am never worked with the html-templates yet ~_-)
thx to <@694560611601743893> also for help there into _expression_ and good of _review_ 💓
only get the `Buffer` complete today: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/>
( each one a day 🙈 )
shit -> writing documentation kills me ....

mhmmm.. will try 9 frames next time (3x3)
6,7 -> 12 -> 24 ... what is best `frame-rate` what the eye is able to see from distance i mean
<@891997325499719730> what do you think .. how to `scale` also into tile-animation-pre-renderedframes simmiliar to mipmapping or what is like"level-of-detail" into 3d ?
but for the fast ones ... why not only 6 ( LOD rendering like )
for really `slow motion` walk i am think i am need at least 128 frames

yeah -> come on alory -> put your animation frames also in .)
sry -> new sample is out now 😂
256 per rail is fullyenough

take care with -> buffer-SIZE-defaults!

how do you wanna like it -> slow or fast or middle of into sync ?

now -> 10 K :;)

PrOGRAAAMMMMM (^_^)
another
i am near to _SPAWN
mhm
<@694560611601743893> i am really need your `help` at now -> should the new `Rails` also include Program and Buffer ?

hope you will `see` it at now.

i will now make them all -> colored

-> have ? ? `no` -> idea
*logo -> REALLY
the vagina of your latest boyOrgirlfriend?
ah.. that one ... > really did not understand (sry -_-)
(maybe into all that engl-letter-combinationsToday -> my eyes was _filteringOUT_)
oh.. pls into german language then!
<@231872730478280705> give ME `your` joke at `NOW` ( or how do you think i am can trust you ? )
tell me how to make more -> `fuzzy` ?
-> into -> `figurative`
<@231872730478280705> don't worry (wanna only show how my lib is working)
np -> the `loop` starter is perfect at now

<@304316646946897920> do you know what i mean (*_^)
woah -> fully crazy `result` by y+=s+=4

(had to concentrate on my `while` loop here -> screencast -> not finnished *LOL ;:)
and.. also had some spring-sex  ?
pls tell me ~
( `brings` my brain at 1000% )
i am like `cold` water
(you know that my `Element` macros can `take fully control about your COMPUTER`)
do you was it ?
logo... some ones downloades also my peote-view lib from REPO
securitaze ?
(best -> who notknowns YET ;:)
(who the hell also ask about a "JOKE" instead of -> `tell one` ;:)
then pls gimme also joKe back
<@304316646946897920> i mean a nother .. . . . .`var`
do we need a -> `size` <- here ?
*lol

?
@half.. how do i am should `do` that while loop at now 😂
don't uKnow -> your personal SECRET -> SERVICE ;:)
eh Alory .. its ok if you are from N S aaaye ;:)
*LOL
\o/
any -> i am think logo is from m6
at first moment i am thought that <@231872730478280705> don't known OWN jokes .-)
tell me a story ? ( <@231872730478280705> asked me today to gimmeJoke 🙈 )
come on Alory ... is my peote-libs not run on your C O M P U T E R s?
-||-
yeah -> now only the `R A I L S` ^^

_interACTIVE_
-> make your graphic -> `INTERGALACTIC`
( and also not only for "walk" i mean ;)
( if you make `animation` at some time i mean -> you can use my libs really simple! )
( -> take your own time into that .)
i know
eh.. is it also working on your computer ?
( <@891997325499719730> this is the `way` how peote-view lib _works_ i mean )
`2.3` is my `cosmo polite` _constante_ tonight (^_^)
<@304316646946897920> \o/ -> i am on `way` (^_^)
sry .. forget also somelittlespice..moment...
<@694560611601743893> shit -> PROBLEM *lol ->
(position and time change)
i am think i have to make both calls into one
contestquestion4now: how to fill 768 pixels with 7 walkers (started by minimal resolution and grows up at each rail)
<@694560611601743893>
(do you have `lime` installed?)
can you show me also into -> `playground` at now ? (feel free to clone and copy ;)~
HA ... have IDEA now -> why not give the `Walker` itself -> right and left meth ?
yeah ..sry about that (do you have a simple solution? [or vim?])
and (for them all) always into `2.3` seconds at now
(simple reverse)
right -> `walker.animX(-walker.size, window.width);`
left -> `walker.animX(window.width, -walker.size);`
eh -> no X anymore -> `automatic`
<@517482359243669524> what do you using, also that one for autocomplete ? ( to much "tooltips" there 4me -> how can i am `disable` ~_~?)
<@694560611601743893> -> do you see why i am using a `while` instead of a `for` loop ?
<@231872730478280705> <@151104106973495296>
(yeah -> moment ... 🚬 )
(or better i am allways start with 16x16  .... and then _simple calculating UP_ ;:)
Or should i am better make all for a `constant` heigt (^_^) ?
mhmmm... but how to make always 7 rows of walkers (in depend of given window.height) ..
and they all have to vary from smallest 16x16 into size (row 0) to biggest 128x128 (row 6)
<@694560611601743893> ok.. found good name now (better into another folder .) -> `walkers-on-rails` ~^
Cool would be also to give it a list of many yt-`keys` ,,, and let it choose a random one (or also for `fallback-solution` if google was delete a link!!!)
[found only some into try.haxe snippets here]
Would like to integrate that directly into peote-view .. or why the hell there is no little haxelib (^_^) who is helping us into that ?
( `#if html5` 4sure!)
that we have no simple `YT.hx` to play a song while the sample is run .)
Half, what really i am missing all the time for the playgroundfun is
we can use my old AssetMacro.hx to fetch it directly into -> playground: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walkcycle-with-variations/src/AssetMacro.hx>
anyway.. is it not logged somewhere? ( it is EU-right to get that!)
(lets `grep` out all my yt-links (^_^)!)
where is that `log-data` ?
wanna write a log-`sraper` 🙂 ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/walkcycle-with-variations/src>
anyway, can you also use that new custom elementare one at now for your old sample ? ( cos someone sayed it "looks laggy" )
i am think better into same folder because the `Walker.hx` is complete at now ...
... but for sure ... if there is `MANY` of them ... why not also give them `@color @anim` \o/
(or better another `main` into same folder? ... that have to `generated` also sometimes for auto-publishing with your tools)
😅 how should i "name" the new sample ?
(more of `documentation` -> can _wait_!)
Half, i am really _tend_ to `spawn` 10K of `Walker` now 😂
I don't think the English language is suitable for jokes
(hard to translate 😅 ;)
-> The one from cow covers the asshole completely.
What is the difference between the tie of a tie carrier and the tail of a cow?
<@694560611601743893> <@891997325499719730> misson complete 🫡 <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/b1ae3ac5dd8249fb53ba2f647376b0a19c0b18ae>
ok -> all `works now`
`0.13` -> ??? *lol `[-> HARD coded IN <-]`
`23` is the last -> `frame`
so for that `cosmologiconstant` -> `0.13` it seems a "size" multiplicator is also need into the holyformula there 😅
( before we can make them all `walk` into _multiple_ horizontal `ROW`s and at different `size` and `speed`+`direction` .)
(... -> some little `multiplicator` on top 😆 )
only problem now is if you change the `size` 😂 (not into `sync` then anymore.. so @formula needs a last _adjustment_ for the `final Walker` \o/)
<@891997325499719730>
near to final now:

||<https://glslsandbox.com/e#109188.0>||

-> THIS is on my TODO at now <-
<@694560611601743893> <@891997325499719730> by the `way` .. i am think we need also that `letter` glsl-fragmentshader into playground...
( with  `@custom` _short_ pointer to a `glsl-hardcoded` `glpyhe-data` i mean ["systemfont"like;:] )

(and the `abstract` superfeature also is _relative_ new)
yes, i am understand how hard it is for haxe to make it _optimized_ into `ALL` of _them_
<@356108561232953344> i am really like to use `abstracts` nowadays i mean (any of that little 🕳️ where maybe only i am specially was trapped inside ;)

(no worry i mean .)

its only 4me to give some -> `feedback`
anyway.. my Color-tool works also over more than `one liner sugar`

to simple `chaining` them .)
2) or do i am `need a macro for`
1) is it possible by only haxe (and abstract + good unrolling all at the end into machine code)
what i am `ask` me:
oh nooooooooooooh (^_^)
it only -> `returns` the value of that "abstract" then i mean and not change the underlaying `integer` imutable ... * ... ~
but is `this` also change -> "that" then .... oh oh ... 😆
(still bookmarked!)
to keep all supersimple there into haxenotation
but .. really -> `COLOR` is totally important for me
(to keep that _Effort_ and to better concentrate here on my -> `renderRenderings` .)
or ... i am also can wait for a newer haxe-version
if that is POSSIBLE

it is cos of `abstract ... (INT)`

i am think it is a `haxe` -> abstract-glitch
(both not work _together_ 💦 )

is that you ?
[at what `time` of `speed` to switch to the `run`-tile-animation {blender-asset->ACTION⛰️}]
e.g. -> `walk -> run` <- physic
i am think for me the next goal is to have a smooth interpolation between more blender `actions`
full moon old friend \o/ -> good sleep & `various` dreams .)
for myself here i am would use into `production` 💯 also!
(but wanna not change api if one times is at `1.0` version)
sure .. all works table together also at now
( peote-text -> this year also i am will polish and document that it is worth to be into haxelib)
🖤
anyway.. is haxelime and peote-view good ENV for you ?
i am really happy to see the old math minds i mean
<@891997325499719730> how deep you are dived later into OpenGL and the superold nehe-samples (throught haxelimeAtThatTime) ?
shitty shitty "Open"->`gl`<- implementations all around .)
(its on my -> TODO!)
(so to keep all html5 compatible .. you allways have to write `2.0` instead of only `2` i mean)
eh Ryn, and i am still not _integrated_ my old `formula` lib
(only by some additional formulas i mean .)
your are really able to turn my walker at sides (only by GPU .)

and is it also able to run into the other direction ?
♥️
thank you ( i am really only thought that half is using out of my local friends here )
\o/
WOAH ... do you TESTED *H UUUG SuperDEEEP
also that is all only to `flip` the texturetile
[no more glsl-optiomzation isnt also possible i am think]
yeah .. better put some `color` animation inside .)
[will keep all the samples there also `up to date` to haxelib-version into `1.0` .... and next `version 1.01` will be only more inline-documentation-fixes and polishing ... all -> SUPERSTABLE there!]
(the more i am wait .. the more -> suspense .)
and also can wait
no hurry ... i am really interested at now on your ones
new folder -> no `merging CONFLICT` i mean .)
and they are -> `mass` -> walker`s` (from now also at different `speed`-`LEVER` *LOL :;)
10 line of code into the main i mean
I am really liked halfwheats one (where they all goes from side to middle .)
(i will `fix` in then into my one instantly!)
pls make into new folder some `variation also`
\o/
do a commit please!
-> `custom` "Walker" s p r i t e 😂
```haxe
class Walker implements Element
{
    // only x position is ANIMATED here 
    @posX @anim("X", "repeat")
    public var x:Int=0;

    @posY public var y:Int=0;
    
    // if the size is negative the till will be "mirrored"!
    @sizeX public var size:Int=-128;

    // ---- calculated by formula inside of glsl ----
    
    // height allways same as width (because it is also `quad` inside of texture-data!)
    @sizeY @const @formula("abs(size)") // but allways keep it non-mirrored here!
    var height:Int;

    // pivot point X need to change if size is negative (tile is x-mirrored)
    @pivotX    @const @formula("((size < 0.0) ? size : 0.0)") 
    var px:Int;

    // texture tile number
    @texTile @const @formula("floor(mod(x * 0.13, 23.0))")
    var tile:Int;    
}```
Also all `formulas` are committed at now ( hope <@694560611601743893> can use also <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> )
there later it will make ->  `sense` ~^
ah ok ( keep your mind `open` for that please! [will help you much also into computer-science!])
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenzwert_(Folge)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence
(wtf... "translation->glitch" *LOL ;:)
Ryn, do you also know about the `limes` (^_^)
(into snippets of people here or even into the haxe cookbook i mean)
yeah, i am really also like the recursive notation into math (you are also not found many cool spice into haxe with that!)
(only the `dimension` of `unlimity` .)
then the dimension is not play any role
(if you are like math -> n-day .)
anyway, Ryn, you have to choose ... 2d or 3d
(i mean for mandelbrot into 3d)
sure .. i am did the`bulbs` at time the `algorithm was FOUND` (by old friends\o/together)
(the dates on my folder _there_ that is not the creation time .. i had many webservers since that)
in 98 ... forget that time
( did tryed at sometimes [before otherones was still burn.] -> http://maitag.de/semmi/pov/ )
`p o v`-ray`?
OR..... one of the best
or new `cycles` one?
do you know blenders old internal ?
(t.hx)
`rn` ?
-> language generator
haxe only transpile
(or its samples)
i mean i am totally get depressive if my lib not run on all targets the same as before
(wanna keep the haxe`power` inside)
(but it only will `float` inside peote-view haxecode if it `runs` on all lime-gl targets !)
ALLWAYS \o/
-> `walker`S ? ;:)
(better lets have more fun with the simple things i mean .. do you have idea how to make more
to complicate to show into simple sample
yeah .. you can combine them all (i am using Blender to create that ones!)
and later you are can also combine that with cool `lightning` (e.g. also 2.5 day ^~ .. look at these sample where you can use the mousewheel to change the `z` position of the light-`source` http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/shaders/normals/)
(you can do also by texture-coordinates if wanna use better texture-atlas-compression .. but for animation the simple `tiling` is fastest way into peote-view)
`simple grid`
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walker-on-speed/assets/walkGreyAlpha.png>
thats the number of texture-tile
(<@694560611601743893> script at now easy makes all our playground-sample easy -> keep `running` and `stable-testing` (+ easy to `show` by send a simple web-link;:)
feel `free` Ryn (^_^)\o/
(each into other direction .)
cool at now would be another sample, where is 2 walkers and `500x256`
`500x128` -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walker-on-speed/project.xml#L10>
oh, and also look at the lime project.xml .. i am did put vsync ON for this sample and also another _screen-resolution_ for non-html-targets
put it inside a `for` loop .. to spawn many ones at now (into different speed!)
( if you change the time ... while interpolate x-position ... it moves more faster or slower .)
<@891997325499719730> here it `spawns`: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/walker-on-speed/src/Main.hx#L52>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commits/master/>
ok, its inside at now:
ok, code is _CLEAN_ ... 1 min
(better only a new template at as it is at now before i am change the main for mass->spawning them)
moment .. will polish all comments and code --- > 5 min!
and you can experiment with more into horizonzal .) ??? ... MHM 😍 ?
but can change also into `walker on speed`
at now the name is "walkers on speed"
(will help you!)
you can also do if you wanna!
(or more -> spawning  `rows` at first .)?
do you wanna `checkout` the new one at now ?
http://maitag.de/~half/peote-playground/anim/
(another variation of this: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/walkcycle>)
new one here on local computer at now only
yeah .. works:
but at first a little `speed test` 🙂 ....
<@694560611601743893> have to switch to the `main` now to _spawn_ some `rows` .)
The Question at NOW also IS: `how it is into other Direction ... and multiple SPEED` .)
(don'T wanna Have a MoonWalker here .)
mhmmm... `0.15` is still to `HUGE` to keep  🦶 `on GROUND` 😂

ok .. i am think i am have it now .....
(if all have negative size to fake a `mirror`-flag)
but have to `adjust` also the `pivot-point` by @formula .)

now looks better:
( *LOL ;:)
( or is it my win10-shit here at now where the `auto-defender` checks every frame for a potential GPU.-ATTACK :;)
( without of that the gpu animation also have `jitter` some times i am recognize nowa ... was that also into older lime-versions ?)
( you are really have to enable also `vsync` by lime-setup!)
and into the `main` only:
```haxe
walker.animX(-128, 800); // params: startX, endX
walker.timeX(0.0, 5.0); // params: start-time, duration
```
now the `tile`-number is _depend_ on `x`-position ( near into `sync` *lol :;)
<@694560611601743893> 😂
have to make another sample there for `various speed` ( and where the tile-animation-speed syncs to speed of position-anim )

i am really hope i get  _`eyeclosethrought`_ that dox-must-have --- > to make also more with 
_blender assets and into `2d` lightning_ 🌅
Half, i am hope we not used it at some other places into playground ... was really shocked last time that some of the lightning-samples not was working again after polishing the `Color.hx` tool.
(any->onlySyntacticsugga.)
(i am think with the `Color` glitch last time .. that maybe could need some time to let write it into a _fully_ methchain https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/1030192290246955049/1227013710489587855 .)
<@891997325499719730> do you tested out more of the samples 😍 ?
(_often is underrated_)
("art of `reduction`" *hugs)
(good also that you don't let me wrote to much into the last pass)
( the `words`-collage was getting like a ping-pong ball between us for at least 5-7 times .-)
Ryn, i am was discussing alone 1h also with Half only about the `header`-text for the view .)
you can also tell me at any time if something is non-haptic into ... (its more complicate at the beginning to use ... instead of the common 2d-apis i mean [cos all gl->oriented 😂 ])
anyway, its ->`started`<- now ... so if all have others have its inline-doc ... -> `1.01` on `haxelib` 😅
no no -> only `PeoteView` is 💯 at now (e.g. Display only 50% and all other -> near to `null` 🙈 ;:)
I am also started new `fontgenerator` prj also today 😅 .... that will make all more simple to have custom font without trickyness for peote-text later!
How goes on with that `2d->mountain and wave` -> procedurals ?
(the rest -> step by step ... and for Buffer and Element i am will `fake it for DOX`!)
*hugs deep
(nice that even the `weblinks` e.g. to <:lime:567735656361492490> -api site is working)
sure
ah, cool
... out of "wordfinding")
(had to look good into dox and vscodium `autocomplete`... was often need to check ...
(much thx also <@694560611601743893> to help me into: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html> ... i am think the others will go faster now)
but anyway (^_^) -> `doxination` is _going on_ \o/
😅 shit, did need 5h today only to complete the inline documentation of the main "view" datatype ...
oh, do you are `collector` of these little `action` figures ?
ah, cool painting!
well .. and self ;) ?
( Element is generated by `@:autobuild` ... so if there is fix or hack for LSP it need to be here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Element.hx#L3> )
also `"haxe.enableServerView": true` into vscodium is useful to see what lsp is doing
mhm, do you have `<haxedef name="peoteview_debug_macro" />` enabled? (you will see then at what time it is generate the Ring)
yep (its also hard for the LSP maybe to figure out what to generate at first .)
mhm, maybe a short hack around can be by put that static functions into a RingUtil class and then: `@:using(RingUtil) class Ring` ?
i am think because Element is a macro .. and also Buffer 😅
mhm, only into that case ... e.g. normally it works:
the Buffer also have an `Interface` <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/BufferInterface.hx>, maybe can using this also for better autocomplete?
i am also only did using class reification like here: <https://haxe.org/manual/macro-reification-class.html> ... together with @:genericBuild ...maybe you can reproduce by this
but how should dox know what "Element" is _generated_ ?
yes, but have no better idea (or i can also exclude that Type completely also from dox)
yes, maybe we can make it _autocomplete_ same as with that dox-condition 😅
(maybe cos of here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Buffer.hx#L6> ? )
(if that can be fixed by some meta-tag for vscodium pls tell me and i will put it in soon!)
or ignore it (its only "autocomplete" :;)
ah, damn ... maybe you can make:  `typedef SpriteBuffer = Buffer<Sprite>;` or something ?
oh ... something with the language-server or vscodium?
ah ok.. maybe `#if macro` ?
mhm, i put that only inside for better `dox` later (problems with autocomplete now?)

~(into `syntax` and `gramar`)~
(do you also using some new haxe -> `t e c h` 🤩)?
And how much into -> `what is a haxe` (^_^) ?
Anyway, is it get better with you and `Flixel` also now ? (e.g. how much of all the samples you still _tryed out_ on own COMPUTER ;:)= ?
that bit kind of -> `help` <- i mean (while sitting into nature on the bench)
anyway .. that was best i am was seen today (out of nature and all .)
(like into some old picture of another artists i am also was seen some times?)
there was a mother sitting on a bench with child ... and helped the child with `floating out of nose`
e.g. i am remember cool scene for me as i am was traveling here into town with bike....
(or go out and remember the `still best moments` .. .and then try to _refigure out_ at home to make it on paper [back from your mind of that `shoot`s])
go out and paint what do you see
no time or what ?
why not ?
ever tryed to paint (by pen at first) -> real persons into nature and township ?
(really scary for my old mind what you are painting there)
into your `pixelgraphic-art`
Why all looks so -> `angry and destructive` ?
oh, some  `single char` by you ?
(how that `both chars` there is -> `communicate`)
(into Flixel -> html5 runtime)
(can'T wait to see it!)
igittigit 😂
with Flixel ?
<@729181341182066749> say it to me!
(and why that "simple" -> effect ? [by color-strand])?
(where is your -> `platon like conversation` <- between your `2` chars there ?)
or do you more the -> graphic NOVEL kind of `artist` `?
(specially with _rythm_ into _mind_ .)
gimme `5` frames .. and i am put into -> peote-playground with some haxe-STARTER-code for you!
Also ... how long do you need to repaint that one to make it -> SMILE ;:) ?
(the face , head and all -> separate animatable!)
(needs a -> hirachically animation datastructure!)
how to make that one singing into battle ?
i mean
make that one -> `animate` (5 frames!)
🥷
another rythm game ?
aaaahhhh

<@729181341182066749> do you starting another graphics novel or something now ?
eh, your last scribbles looks better ?
<@694560611601743893> what would be -> best syntax <- ... for `you my lord` ?
or at all of "converting one colorspace into another one" (also with more or lesser color-chans .)
Sometimes i am think that all that  `ARGB`<->`RGBA`<->`BRGA`.... problems could be better solved
(into on-top-lib-level then) into "sort by insert"-like *lol
(well thinked into API also i mean)
Or is there still a cool superoptimized Color lib already into our cpan?
(could be also its own haxelib for sure ... so lesser code into all other libs who need a simple 32bit/4byte integer to define and mod 4 colorchannels values)
me really wanna have it at best now!
not sure how many `Color` abstracts still exists ( to use also simple integer like into our all html-syntax-one )
`any idea` ^🙂^
Logo, or is it at now only possible by `macro` (^_^) `? [ 💓 ]
don'T know (my yt meme?) ... anyway
Do you know about new stuff into haxe-abstracts over atomic types ? ( that ones what never needs a `reference` and allways is faster by _copyed by value_ ? ;:)
(would gimme hope also if such stuff is planed into newer haxe releases or into 5 ...
 .... so i would let all as it is at now and sometimes later i can better make into _usuability_ there ~~)
that `both` can be used into syntacticsugar there https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/1030192290246955049/1227033489707106344

see you ryn ... thank you for trying out -> l i b .)
(no last -> SD <- for us .) ?
hey, ahve a good sleep
[or i am have to remove all my `inlines` then to make the old `syntacticsugar` work again]
from `logic` -> same into notation i mean

(that bug is following me [had it much while _refactoring_ there to make better for FLOAT and into API namespace)
yes
(this really is a haxe->bug ... it can't really abstract-casting if to much `inlined`;:)
ok, `fixed` <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commit/a8dc6d5af4dc3fa31f57fe54435073f9f8b5fe9a>

get it working ... moment.. will put inside

(shitty all my `inline` here ... haxe not like to `eat` it ... one moment please:
sry.. moment
aahhh.. now it is need to setFLOAT
( cos i am polished into Color.hx ... m o m e n t o ...)
get the same error here
oh.. moment (maybe some regression cos of last polishing... .1 min)
moment, will test here now
is it work also without `-eval` ?

(also with lesser frames ... eg only 5-7 for simple `walk` - char-action)
not good then into -> animation ... will try into some month later again
(also for 128x128)
ah yeah.. get same non-perfect results

ah.. and your own -> results ?
{by SD}
[into `variation` 4sure;:]
( i am really tryed some weeks here and get not good results for good looking animationframes )
what do you used (for trained own lora model-addon?)

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/walkcycle/assets>
last time i am tryed for my old `walk` one -> i am was gived up (only one LORA model was there but also not good results .. also by "controlnet"-addon later)

also if you ever getting stuck .. or need something special into ... i will write `sample` for! ( 📞 me!)
(also if you sometimes really have a usecase into heaps sometimes .. i can easy port it!)
and ui needs also only some little features before complete enough (also there is lesser documentation into all ... and also only 10-20 core-testsamples at now... if you are need help there you can ask me or half at any time!)
<@891997325499719730> the `base` tool is keeped ... into peote-text maybe some little _breaking changes_ later ( but np to fix that ... i am only will polish that one also before i am put into our `haxecave`)
*looks jokingly
(for me also long ago i am researched the _math behind_)
no no no .. the `"signing"` is n a m e (^_^)
🥲
is there also `unsigned` distancefields .... ~^
what i am some often was asking me
(directly on desktop here .) *hugs ryn
*bookmarked
-> wiki -> signed distance field

yeah... that i am will replace soon (by new and better algorithm!)
or only to simple create a textureatlas
is it also have signed distance field ? (also the colored onces?)
yeah, and its only using @deltaLucas old ttfcompiletool for signed distance-field fontrendering at now to create them (and manually written little json config-file for code-banks and so on)
(more work into peote-ui ... but also not much complicated anymore .. only needs its `image`-style now .)
lib only needa small refactoring: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text>
(msdf)
needa to `write` a little fontgeneratortool at first
~~`next` is peote `text`
What i am also ever want to do is moebius-function here directly into haxebot+littleBigInt
step by step <@151104106973495296> .-)
( have here also 5 others on my list to polish up and putting `in` )
for me its also to create some tools what i am think is useful
(to keep more haptic into algorithm solving)
try to `write`more -> recursice functions i mean
`definitively` NOT
`imutable` *LOL ;:)
(alory, do you know that it is still transpiling for the last 7 years)
or learn python .. thats crazy there today
try out perl 5 and then 6 afterwards .)
eh, thats mostly practice (and also some of theoretically researching and training there into!)
(at job also?)
ah, interesting... pls into what of parts of your last programming-work into detail ?
"mostly" `4u` ?;:)~
oh, SD also now ?
method to `proove` something (like into math)
instead of allways the `negation`
you should learn -> what todo .)
(or otherones codestyle?)
what do you mean ? (cookbook=?)
As 4 lines of non understandable `c o d e`
Better 3 lines of `comments` and one `oneliner`
a bit
so -> selfexplained
with lots of comments
c o d e
best at all is good readable
no no
betterBiggerThenLonger
~/`^\#`/
[i am also tryed here again .. but it really detects that it is from same IP .)]
yeah..the bodycounter goes up ( my lib is no `crap` 😂 ;)
*kiss
*lol
*refreshing browser every 5 min
( maybe <@891997325499719730> 💓 )
*lol ( i am only loaded it `once` on other computer at now)
really half.. was it you ?
😆
(who did downloaded it out of me ? ? ??? ;:)

eh alory (still have haxelib parat ?)
(here for the europe users)
i am only hope that all what haxebot is `logging` also is -> _transparent to us_
spamprotection
ah
(especially for me -_-)
also would tell you at first!
so i am sure that ANYONE who would use haxebotcode
(mass-creator-tmpl for some of that `clicky-games` *lol ;:)
(but he -> invites <- me ... _code_ was _ok_.)
(i am remember that logo also sometimes was using my littleBiGint haxelib also into private-githubRepo only)
i mean -> private servers
oh, who one only would use it -> secretly ?
mhm.. don'T you think they would give you an 🪩  `invite` then also  ?
(out of you for yourself only)
someone other also using it ?
(out of here i mean)
?
ah.. is some one others also using it into more of haxe-discord-chatservers=
(also for matrix and other more free chatsoftware i mean)
some day!
hb also really should find its way inside of our libspace
aahh... COOL

np
oh.. sry.. no time at now to maintain sucha _subchan_
(is haxebot also inside of haxelib nowadays?)
feel free to create one and try out my lib and gimme feedback there ! ;:)
yes.. why not
where .. into github ?
yeah \o/
it still had versions before
yes?
now since my lib there is finally inside, i am really would like to be into your `team` there again
isnt <@231872730478280705> here the "organizator" for haxe-ones ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y8w2W1uy2A
<@694560611601743893> where is next jam 😍 <:haxepunk:581178567602339840> ?

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/releases/tag/1.0.0>
(and for each also a new `tag` on github!)
eh, any bugfix or such of will directly flow inside haxelib also from now!
(and the 4 dowloads of `input2action` tolds the whole story of .)
<https://lib.haxe.org/u/maitag/>
😅 at now i am think i am the only one who installed it by `haxelib`
{no long and timeintensive git-cloning is need anymore .}
[without 8MB .git *lol]
(the  `destilate` of 60 KB zipped code :;)
Do you also will using it into future direcly from ?
any, i am soooo happy to put that old sucka finally into haxelib at now (the `view`)
4me to .. best also is the elevator-scene 😆
(or _fear and laughning in las vegas_ 😂 )
(the first time i am thought on jhon travolta into pulb fiction also [the discostage-scene;:)])
_satterdayNightFever_
*lol ... yeah, also have something from play-hall or bowling meeting point
(that colors .. .and bw-stripe ones on stage ... awesome)
LOVE IT
_pleeeaase_ <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
and into 🪩 ?
(looks like build by colored-glass)
aaahh... interesting motiv
(the first ones are the bests)
gimme pls \o/
try it out also .. .what was your best one at now ? (only seen the "disco"-zebras at now into the other haxe-chat)
congratulation (this also was one of many of `keyword`-prompts there.)
( <@694560611601743893> 😂 ... also this one somewhere _i n s i d e_ there *lol -> )
( found this at now into imgs of my last SD-session and with "haxe"-theme )

what lib do you using ?
yes, all the same shit
microsoft wan't to suggest you to buy a xbox 😂 ?
if you really wan't to see also what haxe is generating for your _custom spritelike_ ...
_uncomment_ here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Element.hx#L2248>
(but should be also into `autocomplete`, e.g. by vs-codium)
Have to put that sometimes into better output by a compiler debug-define (same as that ones for shader and all other parts at now)
There is many ways to make it (very useful for e.g. particles) ... have to make more simple samples for all these metas there.
no, if you have `@anim` together with `@const` (so hardcoded inside of glsl at end and not generated for haxe to change)
then you can set `@constStart(value)` and `@constEnd(value)` directly there to control the animation/value-interpolation
( you can also interpolate into "constant", "repeat" or "pingpong" mode )
here you also have another "@anim" sample: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/elementAnim/src/Animation.hx> ( e.g. `cStart` is the start value for the color elem-prop "c", so to interpolate from cStart to cEnd into the "Position"-duration-time)
Or look at this, e.g. if you wanna have same size for with and hight (radius into that case) and automatically calculate the pivot-point allways into the middle (and also injects little glsl to draw a circle into fragment-shadercode) <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/echo/gravityDraw/src/Circle.hx#L10>
(it also generates the functions what you can call then to animate a property for a duration of time ... all this needs peoteView.start() into your main [for the time-uniform] ... but even this can be made by custom uniforms or @custom properties( vertex-attributes then)
a more simple "animation"-sample is this one here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/anim/simple/src/AnimColPosSprite.hx>
( if something is `@const` it is like hardcoded inside shader at the end and you can not change it ... but there it is changed by a `@formula`, so the tile-number for animation change only if the raindrop is near to the ground in y position)
(and they more or less animate automatically ...also that splash at the end ;)
so each raindrop there have special custom properties also (what end up into glsl-shadercode)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/anim/rain/src>
good example also is this: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/rain/>
yeah (also e.g. if you element don't need rotation you can remove that to have it more optimized into generated haxe and shader-code)
and with the other (blueprint) ElemFloat you can move you sprite more accurate by float position (e.g. subpixels)
e.g. this one is using Integers for position an size: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/element/Elem.hx>
there are some pre-defined Elements (you can also copy them and reduce to what it only needs)
what is your problem with `ml` ?

someone converted it by hand ?
via `wrapper`-=?

that is not really a -> COMPUTER <- for me

if not better have to do i mean

by more "monsters" 😂 ?
it is to make it easyer to extend your game maybe ?
so you are allways have your own or what .) ?
dear spile
but never really seen some of your own code

i am really like that you do it `also` now
Half, if you need "canvas" -> you are name your `ELEMENT` like that i mean (^_^)
(like to see into some of variations into playground i mean)
can be easy _abstrahated_ into other -> files
Display and Program+Buffer
i mean if you are need it fast at _jamtime_

no "play"-"state"
no, only -> gl-renderer

(or optically illusion?)
not at same speed they are _started sometimes i mean

do you see how "slower" it "goes" ? (at end)

<@231872730478280705> link please!
i am only hope that <@385014891750096896> not see your last code-prj. where u are `use` it
<@231872730478280705> ?
<@415825875146375168> "sponsoring" by `good code` or what ?
<@694560611601743893> who is _spOnsOring_ the `arch` ?
(ubuntu ? *lol ;:)
and who is _sponsoring_ debian ?
oh, big "sponsor" or what ?
only "red hat" i am not really like (cos of bad experiences)
aha ( gentoo also nice ! ;)
([cos of `hardwarechanges to much` .)])
(have to _reinstall_ here also on 2 computers next time)
i am personally really happy that some old haxecoder still maintain the `haxe` dpkg
arch have good -> wiki (better that into that ubuntu-shithere)
(all other will -> distract!)
`i3`
i am hope you are also use
what then ?
brave
`arch` 🐯  ?
what is your linux-distribution ?
(that it have not be to new 🙈 or something *looksadly)
(i am remember on windows there was a "glitch" with python-version at one point)
not sure what other SD ones are using on linux
gpu->optimization
for `tensorflow`
what maybe anywhere can be problem is -> `cuda`
(cos -> no python [version] problems! )
(on linux it have to be much better as on my win10-shit computer here)
oh, you are still -> installing ?
(or virtualbox)
install `qemu`
your haxe code
all fast enough now!
(and test it inside of a windows->qemu)
then you need a `crosscompiler` .-)
simple -> installing (i am like "aptitude" also .)
no stress
(i am like the silence of debian stable running system)
no
Halfwheat, i am a -> `debian monk`
no
dpkg? (debian ?)
what all you installed ?
byCycles?
[f R a C t A l]?=
(some of my volumetrics into blender ?)
`GraphicPROCESSINGunit` ;:-)?
your new
`TEST`
or do you really wanna
<@694560611601743893> come on -> SD -> now (installationtime < 1/2 h;)
Do you also tryed out `glsl-sandbox` out of "shadertoy" ? (is that same as easy to -> `migrate` ?)
only -> `demo`-_scene_ (^^)
i am think you don't need "API" anymore
the only wiki on github i am remember there it was relatively ok into informationflow was the one of Armory3d (more _effort_ there of some gurus to keep -> up2date!!!).
( for me its more _confusing_ instead of have all into a simple `readme`-chain )
i mean to `edit` there ... or do you ever edited inside a github wiki ?
the github-wiki is also not for every one ...
( but at the moment where i am _read_ "docker" -> i am still stop then 😅 )
i've read also into dox-wiki today much about: how to put into _holy_ `CI`
( .-> o n ly -> `generated` ! )
(later also -> peote-text-api) -> so i can best find it back into my HELL of files and folder-`namespace`-structure .)
I am really like to `fill it up` now (and i put into -> haxelime/peote-view-api)
if you need -> API <- by 🖖
put into your home-folder there!
do you think that would be better _path_ ?
(still works like a _charme_ -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/generateAPIdoc.sh>]
`Any` -> i am used it `TONIGHT` ;)

<https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox/wiki/Using-Dox>
(some wiki-entries also points into NIL -_-)
(how to say ? ... dox needs maybe more self doc 🤣)
(really.. not much to find into dox wiki *lol )
aha (and where ?)
(need some good and _stylish_ css now .)
by the way, how do you handle DOX (for haxebot i mean) ?
_*turns into a `ghost`_
_*remembers roughtly_
Whats your latest there into _lime-gl es 2/3_ ?
(or you still using only the oldstable versions)
_to keep that old `port` open_ i mean -^^-
you are only get sure that it is still _running_ if you get all _samples work again_ (best if vujadin do it sometimes [knows its own code at best and what is need to change {maybe also for some new improvements into `babylon`-format and api}] )
yea yea ... the old problem with OLD libs ^^
( s o m e .... d   a    y   ° . °  ... °.° ..)
maybe more easy way to have also a `3d` layer inside peote-view would be to make it heaps compatible and using `h3d` from there.
*lol ... somewhere Vujadin also was using `operator` as variable name (what is now a haxe->`keyword` < - it seems 😂 )
(cos this could be really integrate now also into a peote-view custom `Display`)
<https://github.com/vujadin/BabylonHx>
Last time i am tryed to make `bhx` compatible again to newst lime and haxe ( the first steps was ok ... but then to many errors into follow)
(would maybe `break` all *lol ;:)
mhm, not sure openfl or flixel would using it
tell me if it runs (i can explain all there to you and how it works [what i am yet found out since novembre])
SD (^_^) ?
anyway, <@694560611601743893> ... how is going on ? ( after the new _assembled_ one ^_^ ==??=?== )
( [ <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/tree/main/texture/assets> ] )
( have extra some new sample for this cool feature now here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/texture/src/TextureDataPNG.hx#L66> :)
( and 2, 3 or 4 times lesser GPU ram is used then if you need not fully RGBA [or ARGB...] what lime supports only )
or can also encode now png-greyscale/grey-alpha images by `format` lib (`TextureDate.fromFormatPNG(bytes)`) supersimple
so i am only have to type now: `program.setTexture( Texture.fromData(TextureData.RGBfrom(limeImage))  , "custom");` to set up single jpeg image by oneliner 🙂
-> <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/TextureData.html#RGBfrom>
but found a way now to convert all inside my peote-view `Texture`(lime-gl) where it is only using RGB (e.g. for jpeg ;)
Ryn, sometimes i am also wish some more improvement into lime, e.g. into image-formats (there is allways only 4 col chans .)
remember that <@694560611601743893> sometimes tested with newer versions there ...anyway, i am allways happy if all runs out of the `lime test ...` box here .)
(`@ 68daa12`)
<https://github.com/openfl/lime/tree/develop/project/lib> -> hashlink
?
is hashlink also more stable nowadays ... i am not sure into this (using mostly the version what is _shipped_ inside lime lib)
do you created a branch for _migration_ ?
(i am sometimes also think for the lime tools ~~)
ah yeah, for haxelib it would be cool to migrate to hashlink if there all will be better then ~_~
Or do you have to much effort to keep the neko-src and `.n` generation up to date?
why you wanna get rid of ? ( it is working stable and faster to build ...so better for just-in-time testings ;)
(ha, `.label-inline { display:none; }` did it inside styles.css \o/ [ <@694560611601743893>, all only need to _fill_ at now ~^ <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-api/peote/view/PeoteView.html> ])
(maybe by css hide-style for `label-inline`-<span> ..anyway, i am happy at now 😅)
aha: 1) `    --keep-field-order` -> works <:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
Now only 2 glitches left (4me;) ... 
1) how to make into same order as inside of code (not alphabetically)
2) how to remove all the "inline" markers ( its to much to read for normal api-browsing i am think )
don't worry ( i am long time not was using it .)

haha, now it works ... fantastic
oh wait ... maybe i put into wrong part (the xml-generation) ... moment...
not work -_-
```Error: Could not process argument https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/tree/master/src/peote/view/
Invalid character: :```
( also not help to put url inside single or double quotes or quoting the `:` in url )
( aha, the "view source" maybe by `-D source-path ...`:
<https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox/wiki/Default-theme-examples#example---themecolor-textcolor-title-website-and-logo> )
yeah (or maybe somewhere is better theme) ... also question: How to order the fields at how it is inside the code and not alphabeticallyByDefault ?
I am wonder also how to make that "show source" link button on top (or at best on each field),
like how is inside haxes api (this would be very useful) ... is this only possible by changing the template ?
Dox-out seems a bit ugly anyway 😂 ... maybe some things then can be adjust by html-template later
(autocomplete also work ... so it show me all forwarded once)
because its methods are `forwarded` ( not wanna that someone use the `TextureDataImpl` directly)

```haxe
#if (!doc_gen) private #end
class TextureDataImpl
```
aahhh... now it works
(or writing all manually ,)
ive have to try to exclude the "private" keyword by conditional compilation ... forgot how that was for dox
"show" was showing the "link" of whats behind of the abstract ... but not generating the file .)
mhm... trying also `#if (!dox) private #end`now ... but some mistake i am think
yes
oh, with non-"private class" it generates also the impl-type now ( not optimal but at now it is acceptable )
mhm, also did only gimme link now to the underlaying type (to a file what not exists) ...
maybe i am really need to put that into another .hx file (not really wan't to do this 😢)
( will try "@:dox(show)" there now ... moment)
ahh... have that underlying type: `private class TextureDataImpl` ... maybe because of this ?
mhm, is it maybe then because i am have both types into the same file ?
(here it _forwards_ and the impl-class is above [the impl-class also not shown inside of doc] <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L624>)
Some short "Dox"-question:
If i am have an `abstract` with _@:forward_ of some underlying _implementation-type_,
how can i let it also shown these _forwarded props and methods_ as part of the abstract itself into doc-generation ?

(sry, have no write-access to main "haxe"-channel here 🥲 ;)
<@1032479338005794816> you can do by blit <https://api.haxe.org/haxe/io/Bytes.html#blit> or also by BytesInput and BytesOutput (e.g. more for bytestream there)
into the tests <https://github.com/tbrosman/hxmath/blob/master/test/hxmath/test/Test3D.hx>
seems there is no flixel-dependencies ... (outside of heaps and openfl it is also tagged "cross")
maybe also this one: <https://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-gl-matrix/> (they using it into mini-mihty-2d-engine)
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/hxmath/>

_(near to `find` it now .. anyway, can also render deeperlata^^)_

i am think the yt->song from Umngane Wami

so where all is using precalculated `samples` nowadays for.
only the "soundwave"-presets [not much more was possible out of _modulating_ them i mean]
no, i am not mean the amount of simmultaniously channels to play into
i mean how to generate more then `beep` sound into different frequency (on computers before)
sinus, cubic and triangle one (also called

how many wave-form-presets do you had on Atari at that time ?

1) img into blender-> 2) modeling only the two eyeball-visible-mesh-parts-> 3) blender-compositor with same as into old sample-> 4) the rest into peote-view then is `trivial` then to _compose at `runtime`_;)
( Half, into peote-view we can use uv-spherical mapping to make that ones into eyes -> animation .)
by SD maybe by controlnet or lora (i am only tested that one times at now, and also no own post-trainingprocess)
you can put anything inside by gimp or krita or ps also nowadays into some 1/2 or hour .)
that `machinelearning` can do like _this_ also ...

i am found crazy there how SD is put the mirror-image into the eyes at that one
yeah
(that one i am call: kitchnMachineCat ;)

what you ever wanna do
MOST is make you -> DREAMING .) ?
ryni, what is your most famous thing into programming and computer what
to re-`knot` to something _other_ .. `helpful thing` (^_^)
but you know ... maybe some times later -> can be useful `material`
forSure-> its only the RAW-output
`?
🚽
or ->
what do you think ? (should i am @:keep ?)
i am totally like that latest one with the 2 noses

(or background into parallax2Dsroller)
(to animate it ... i am gived up at now .. but for `stills` .. like for a `cardgame` or something ... why not 🙂 ?)
for little -> computergamecreations .) ?
to using this new image-generation-tech
some here ever thought about ..
or if not cell-agent-scriping ...
<@231872730478280705> do you only `Flixel/Ceramic` ?
i am really would like to `talk` about that (hard to find someone)
or do you like -> conways game .) ?

(it is -> `rendering` <- _still into background_ .)
at `realtime` [like into a _Stream_ but only THE BEST ;:)->4u

( funny is for me -> that it was need 10 years to make version 2 *LOL ;:)
anyone did into ceramic also (^_^)
What do you think about my new `gameoflife`-demo 🙂 ?
(my ui really also needs some more time into peote)
yeah -> never think about how long it will need !

*hugs <@978884238499803196>
apropos... that gimme cool idea
(but never used it, most i am forgot .. some of higher level function imports .. maybe ?)
remember only haxe-feature ... to simple call functions or _using_
i am hope you mean "class" and not only static main with main-function 😅
mhm, what should that be ? (is not all there only a Sprite-Child ?)

e.g. into that now i am found cool _spaceship_ or something byside:
really fast nowadays:
that the little sureal pixicats  what it is generate for me (stable diffusion) is my friends .)
<@1130931692786426056>

<@369949680081174538> here, for you (^_^)

any why ;) ?

armageddon ... mhm (i am allways remember on old sound there ;)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway
yep, it is (from Conway .. old perlguru!)
I am think it would be interesting to give the cells in different areas of the screen also different cell-rules
( e.g. some other animated graphics make influence how the cells are morphing at different areas )
yep, 4 times faster to fill and transport the texturedata to GPU on each simmulationstep
its not much different into glsl of this here:  <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/gameOfLife/_starter/src/GameOfLife.hx#L78> (only you have to read the texture-values from side-cells maybe little bit other way to avoid the `if`s)
(but implementation should be very easy nowadays)
mhm, not sure to do this soon ... its also fast enough .)

hey, use the `reminder` with _care_ ~_~ ;:)*lol
( i am to much `code`, `music` and `movie` affine)
np, tell me into your own words then
i am only know ONE movie (some new one from southafrica) where is simmiliar freaky "abduction by alien" scene
: 👽 :
wait the _moment_ where Christopher Walken gets _catched_
<@694560611601743893> https://youtu.be/3WxszUjVMD8?t=625
i am think it was this -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communion_(1989_film)
it was -> one of them!

i am really can try to find that `scene` at now on `yt` but really not sure it is to much -> `shocking persons` here (^_^)
<@215582414544699393> do you know the superold movies with chris walken into main-actor role (and what that aliens did with him ~^;:)?

What i am was looking for was that old sureal sf alien trashmovie with `Christopher Walken`
it was the `actor` of `sleepy hollow` also ! ( "Der Hesse" ;:)
<@694560611601743893> aaahhh ... REMEMBER NOW ... \o/ (the mainactor was some one other older ones .)

adios du alter nordenländer

will be a cock fight
they all wanna make more MONEY with that!
??? -> facebook
??? -> apple
??? -> google
gpt -> microsoft
yet (lets wait what googles "answer" will be)
(chatgpt is good for questions like this *lol ;:)
this it was
answer:
now *LOL
i am really was asking chatgpt
AHHH
(^_^) [will strange marture my brain also to find the name of that other superold sf-trashmovie with William 4you next time!!!]
{before you _seen it_;:)}
[not wanna `spoil`.]
(i am only say -> egon schiele!)
"inside" really is for art lovers 4sUr3
(but not like into his `sureal` ones before .)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_(2023_film)>
yeah
look "inside" -> its really like "survival"->`ART` .)

do you _Seen_ latest ?
cool also was `inside`
(from _style_ it was a cronenbergONE ;:)
(maybe some of the old cronebergs .. anyway 😂 )
(shit.. can't find it back .. but i am sure it was Dafoe there)
yeah .. he is also play into many good movies
*lol
yeah -> ask chat GPT
(also german titles is different)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Dafoe_filmography
(maybe also the beginning of alzheimer here into my brain)
(shit .. why i am not remember the name of movie ... and only some pictures and scenes)
it was some kind of `sureal` movie also!
no
`metallic flexible probe` (no computeranimation also!)
only remember that
from 70 or 80th
not remember the name
they put into him (after _catching up_ ;:) 🌌
and some metallic `sonde`
with the younger Willem Dafoe
eh, i am really remember a crazy movie at now
*lol
_ship_ ;:)
if they beam them up to its
what aliens put into
is it what i am think
(no time to read a book also)
_OVER_read°!°_
only -> to long to read ->
no really -> interaction also i am think
(even while _walking_ the streets)
(allways looking at mobile-devices)
overdose
information -> flood
the society is also sometimes -> not what humans need
(or bad parents)
or no parents
or to much `stress at work` .)
can be also cos of all the `plastic` into water
or also alzheimer
maybe drugs will make it to get it more early
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenie
-_-
into his or my words now:  `filter broken`
(he told me also that without braindowner-pills he still listen and see to much -> all directly is `floating` inside `brain` then!)
I sometimes met my old friend on the street later, but because of the strong medication he was no longer the same as before the illness
could go on and on about some really crass things here ... but I'd rather not (for the sake of the children ;)
during a schizophrenic seizure (the same friend later explained to me) everything is really like in another reality (e.g. he once shot at a bird's nest because he really saw aliens there)
I once drove a car with my buddies ... then there was a schizophrenic attack at the traffic lights ... he got out and crushed the cross that was there (accident victim) ... but all the other drivers stared at him in horror (I'll never forget that)
eh, sometimes it's really not funny anymore (schizophrenia is a serious illness)
😢
What I find very frightening at the moment is that with the pharmaceutically marketed phentanly
( have seen some videos from USA .. 
  -> it really was like into a `zombie movie` )
I've seen quite a few people go crazy here
from simple psychoses to complete schizophrenia
or some into life-change after the wall was broken here (east/west-germany)
maybe it also was the alcohol and all kind of together
some also into -> `asylum` <- now
mhm, i am know some people here who get burn its brain by to much pills (some one i am remember was climbing the rain gutter up to 3.th etage)
sometimes i've used some of them: http://maitag.de/semmi/blender/circdots/example_images/
for what do you need ?
🌛 ~
(have still some glitches there if you move mouse-sphere by mousewheel into z-coord)
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/fragDepth/
4all into 2d i am have to use my own little lime based ones
(there into past i am remember also strange community to make it all easy _scriptable_ by haxetool)
_the_ blender+haxe -> unreal <- _workflow_
What i am really would to like to try out sometimes would be
(oh no [not wanna install godot here]... maybe sometimes later)
is godot the "must have"-dependency ?
(or is that -> _impossible_ ~~)
Umngane Wami, would gd-script interpretor also run inside of peote-view env ?
yeah, better use that-ones what is more _near to pure haxe_ 🫂

what do i am need to install to test that out also here on my computer locally ?

but how can you be into team if your own `math knowlede` lacks ?
how good do you are into math ?
also much you send here i am have seen already by reading all about into documentation about that specially local peace of machinelearningsoftwarelastof

so if you need h3d, maybe you can port it to lime

(only Lime based!)
hey, you can try with my simple "peote-view" !
oh, what docs especially ?

How many years do you think will be for `172` .) ?
🙈
<@525025580106907659> i am really think i am will switch for simple scribbling also into `pure blender` at nowa ( mypaint have some bugs here siince new winshit-version)
why do you make this `collage` ?
oh oh
(long time not seen)
cool -> `peek` and `poke` functions
oh, (what is "picotron"?)
or also OpenCL ... much more compatible stuff nowadays 🙂!
anyway, there is some cool `OptiX` at now also as alternative (what supports my old OSL-shaders, so i am don'T need to build blender anymore to have it gpu-optimized)
Into Blender and cycles there also it runs better on nvidia-gpu (cuda) ... also for building blender...
don'T know (only that last years the nvidia ones was better supported there)
best also is to look what is best for stable-diffusion (torch and gpu-optimizations) at now ...
i am think into some of time all will be work same also for amd-support (its only the drivers what lacks for ml there i am think at nowadays)
yeah.. with 16GB its really fun -> only ~10 seconds to generate a 1024x1024 image
yes, you don't need 8 or 16 GB gpu-ram (but i am think a more new model, e.g. my old nvidia 9800 ti was not working at that time)
(thats the easiest way to install all locally on your computer)
<https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui>
try it out, its really interesting
oh, do you also playing with Stable Diffusion at now 🙂 ?
what is this for ?

and then not anymore `lime ...` -> `peote ...` then (if you wanna also have the `tools` includet)
(i put all of lime code inside my lib code if you wanna [only what is NEED])
-> no more dependencies then out of `libc`native .)
eh, if you gimme love -> i can make all -> `INLINE` !
so you wanna have peote-libs -> pure hxml ?
if you not like the existing ways
-> than make it JSON :;)
oh, why ?
hxp is not your thing also ?
feel free to start a sample into hxp half into -> playground!
why , you can do the same also by hxp
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commits/master/>
its _own_ -> READERS ;) ?
or is not BETTER that LIBS should `I M P L E M E N T`
e.g. do you need a `writer` [ @to ] for the -> `vision` or `pi_xy` libs ?
into 🌉 ing :)
coherence
for me important is
on how your are like it
depends
ML
or "YAML" anY
and nothing have todo with "XML"-shit
hxml is haxe
(my hope is that "ceramic" will be -> longer `stay` into!)

to put your SPRITES simple on SCREEN ?

eh Logo. come also to peote  -> all is much more easy and crosstargetcompatible!
(not our holy haxelib`stack`)
eh, microsofts githubshit is -> DEASASTA
why?
i am not see you there
so how many libs you ever wrote half ?
(to `submit` or to `update`)
if i am `call` it
easy to remember options
good old tool
no, haxelib is -> minimal
anyway, i am only put libs into haxelibs where i am not will change API for next 5-23 years
or dpkg
mhm .. i am only know CPAN
pure git or what ?
eh, did someone put some better lib-share thing into your mind ?
/supereasy
(like with "vision" today)
is what i am need
`haxelib install ...`

about `statistics`

also: why "free"
<@729181341182066749> if you `really` need `feedback`!

<@729181341182066749> can you change this please and send back ? ( the little `l`-etter into "play" ?)

(have also much of woman-artist-friends, who really like to paint/create pictures of genitals of men)
or why do you was -> `complain` at that time ?
(there is much -> "brainwashing" campaigns of propaganda all the time to disallow ->human body painting)

yes

no no -> its -> no need of `Any`

`art` have often no _usecase_
and call it "art" ,)
wtf is this ... some one put a pissuar at the wall
and people who goes into galery at that time though about ...
oh, i am remember that ( ny -> much years ago .. piece of art -> BREAKER ;:)
with `real` friends and all of family
i am also think that nothing can replace our old rememberings of peace and harmony

with that great "play"->button ;:)
hey, you are really find much -> "users" <-
(out of internetLAGTIMEforSure)
not really a `realtime` thing (4me)
or to hack and moddify it
allways you have to change some files
yes, but they can not edit it at runtime together (that is what i am wanna do sometimes)
good to know you have a `strict` goal into frontOfYourEyes
(for play-button decoration)
eh, but then you are using "gif" 😂 `?

What do you think about "ceramic" nowadays ? (is it also into try.haxe as optional lib nowa .. i am not looked yet ~ ~)
if you know what i mean ^~
spile, my stuff is more like -> processing .)
little demo there)
pixi i am never used (only wonder why was still into libs of try.haxe but never seen a sample or ...

[into `peote-view`]
[cos all was writtn again from scratch into haxe 3.47 at that time]
<https://github.com/maitag>
(also version 2 [but i am called it "remaster"-version ;:)
that lib was born together with NME and OpenFL and later LIME
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/?C=M;O=D>
my focus it to make OpenGL for `2D` more easy to handle
(runs also on everywhere.. thx to lime-base-framework [also raspi from beginning])
sure (its ->minimalistic)
like what i am and <@694560611601743893> is doing
it is also more for artists
och... much of

WOAH .. this is HAXE-UI into -> RUNNING SYSTEM \o/ (uSafeMyAlsoRestOfNightToDAY;:;:)
awesome (^_^) ~
<https://github.com/maitag/haxe-shaderfun>
(and he helped me so much to get `use` of first prototype 💓 🌊 )
codet haxe-ui -> `2` <-
i am was first one who was trying to make some "real" application for Ian as he
(he is thinking same as you .)
nah, then you go good with <@385014891750096896> s UI ;:)
me
for
haxe is `bread`
fuck on money
(to find best way _throught complexity_)
yeah -> self organizing little teams *hugsDeep!!!
i am also would use haxeui! (for "reach"-content-stuff -> easy to setup and to share with other people who don't know about programming)
i mean before doing to write massive of CSS and other XML-like-SHIT ...
(haxeui is GREAT!!!! ♥️ tool)
oh .. what .. haxeui ... thats sounds like -> boilerplate for me .) [only for me->NP]
hey, by peote-view -> easy to make as a shater (lesser loading time!)
is you only target html5 there ? (supercool stuff!!!)
ah.. yeah..remember u using ffmpeg (the lib directly by extern bindings ?)
[around play-button]
especially that shader-GLSL one :;)
i am wanna see -> haxe- SOURCE ;:)
ff
(around that PLAY-but;:)
wtf COOL shader also :;) !"!!

what is need from cloud... ?
interesting project (not only gameshit!!! *hugs deep)

ah yeah .. i am remember ...
(by telling me this 🖤 )
\o/ u safe my day!
i am also like to build 🌉 to other _frameworks_ or programmingLANGUAGEspice
Its ok i mean .. sometimes there is more things to do out of haxespace at first
What do you working on (haxe | not ;:) ?
(still gets slowly ->perfect<- .. need more _samples_ :;) ~~
i am into haxe still try to make peote-view haxelib ready: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commits/master/>

<@729181341182066749>


yeah*lol
(like an old virus into machines trainingdata)
why iam allways see this everywhere

mhm -> is all looking shit (not like our original ;)



(as what it was _thought about_)
pls.. gimme also totally another input-txt to that SD
mhmmm.. i am think "standing on platform" also is totally not what is have to stand on




mhmmm.. interesting .....
ment ...
.... " with ||hand on sexualorgan|| on its back ...." *LOL ... m o
lets change pls this into correct english
this is what SD thinking about your and my painting
"a drawing of a person standing on a platform with a cat on it's back and a sky background"
o key .. half, let me pls DELETE the word also from the positive prompt :)

ffff......
the
what
lets try out a `negative` prompt ... moment
or
-> is it only me or do you also see allways -> 🐈‍⬛ imean ;:) ?
mhm... but we really should change that -> `auto` detected `prompt`

and now by our image:

back ->
interesting is what i am get out by only that prompt
(next time .)
no no
(how did it know that by my brushstrokes ? ... or do you put something in .. ? ... or the stroke-py-algorithm ;:)?
cool -> mandelbrot
```a drawing of a person standing on a platform with a cat on it's back and a sky background, Benoit B. Mandelbrot, storybook illustration, a storybook illustration, sots art```
ok, this it the _prompt_ it was detecting by our poor little painting:
(only since someone into armory-chat told me i am have to try out the -> XL <- version .-.)

did also get that ERROR ...
moment ...
what it is "think" what is keywords for 😂  ...
oh.. no no .. lets ask stable-diffusion at first ...
what is your keywords for ml-brain ?

what the stable-diffusion-model `SAY`s -> about .)
ok, half .... i am think its time at now for me and you to see ....



it was cos of that glitch and i am disabled the mouse for painting (what also not really was helping)
ahh... sry
(any what iam try to do -_-)
i can not paint inside anymore
or no ... the layers are -> OPEN
(i am tryed here so much 🙈 )
oh .. wtf .. why you are -> locked all the layers there ?
f an t ast ick!
[but still old mypaintproblems that i am can not using my mouse after painting into anymore since win10-shit *lol..any;:)*h u g s

(cp a sonic head inside pls)
to let us know -> you are there .)
(fileformat)
or data into header of ff
or change some pixels
(a meme-bot :;)
to let us know also what you not a bot
then write something into halfs ora file please
by sending me some -> presets ?
manipulate what i am will still paint into soooon
or do you wanna
^^
to write into halfs at first
nah Alory, you get the chance
_*\*_~ *plugged in the tiny bamboo gt____
he he .. you wanna firt paint into halfs cool nightly or not ?
*\*wearing the headphones
yeah, we all better shoud: combine and connect
to combine that later with my coding-pyramid ^
Alory, i am also wanna become more into graphic->artisting-> m o m e n t
<@694560611601743893> last time my only output at end was -> `pingpong` into 2 variations *lol ~ ~  .... ° ..^.
[and for sure will send you also then! ... np *hugs]
into graphic-creation-spicyness .)
anyway, my Plan is to use into Future also Blender for ALL 😂
(but there is only superold version .. maybe the coders are try to give it to the young python developers)
scribbling!
->
oniclike)
normally i am using mypaint only for superfast(s
perfect (then will send you next time this format!)
is blender also run onto your mac?
how do you try to let it -> walk ?
mhm, also -> hackintosh ?
then you can learn unix on that little machin!
you should wish you an raspi from you parents!
y/n
_whilepainting_
yeah, to much brushes also can make you insane
yep (and discord also will deleting all files after a while)
we using -> `Blender` now (blender.org)
<@729181341182066749> or do you just ignoring our stuff what we made -_+
!Alory.. what do you painted into our old `.ora` file ?
`back`
is
the old `urchin`
<@694560611601743893> i see not smoothShrink == true .)
what is this `?
(or what not can be easy fixed into some hours byside)
but this will not need to change anything into existing code
the only what is missing is the `image-style` :)=
also we developed it together (i am was put often inside what you was need)
peote-ui is so powerful at now ... you really can using it
more like an -> _interface_
sure .. i am remembering
at same time you also make sound
at same time you paint them
(any line should make -> sound!)
or better -> combine both !
half, try to make it simple like turbostone
u are
(i am pray every day he will continue old modtrackerprj)
he is the profi into this!
for audio stuff you have to ask <@694560611601743893>
minimalistic
mega
i am like that you are using it for some supersimple graphicstyle and mechanic
by my old blendertool!
i can make it -> `WALK`
you should gimme by the old blenderfile i am put in here (for 5x7 animation starter!)
sinners .... ~^;:)?
(from zig y stars and all .)
only if you are sometimes back into -> `haxeland` :-)
me to
(or together with the face-pixelart)

wonder about we can doing same now with
http://maitag.de/~half/2023/
<@694560611601743893> my _original_ plan as you maybe remember was using peote-net for this ( like into much of prototypes what still exists into net/playchamber)
we really need some perl-spice to make our "sharingdata" avail if url-data-storage (or browser buildingIns=
-> `lacks`!)
sryAboutWTF ?
(base64 only at the end)
it have to be optimized for your strokes-data
cool also would be to store each holy creation into -> URL (by hardcompressing!)
also by input2action lib at now!
yeah, you can make more -> shortkeys
yeah, i am really press my thumbs together you will keep it up to data!
also best forever -> that what we did into "lines" -> visualization + editing (by you!!! ♥️ =)
all what you are doing there it make my heart jumping again
yeah
-> put it -> IN ;:)
but your old cool other stuff ... hey
so -> LDTK .> its ok if you not wanna upload into the common "sandbox"
to climb more up into my graphically 2d-littlePeoteFramework
but you know .. if i am make a new sample .. it allways have to keep to be a little 🪜
have it also into -> `monochrome`
what do you think ? ... isnt that good -> `TESTDATA` ?
https://try.haxe.org/#e716a7e2
and then each pixel is another maze if you zoom (endless) inside .)
i mean .. what if we are using it
but still also not found it back
somewhere is my old `maze` code also ... into play-box
again
i am should write a `demo`
you are s u r e
-> into that fuckingLIBeaaast ?
?
z a t i o n ;:)
m i
(or to make that last of -> o p t
only to KNOW ?
or why i am wonderly coding some stupid algorithm AGAIN
(before my holy libs are _finished_ ;:) =?=
do y<ou wonder why i am not writing a game or something ?
i am also only a lonley haxeoldcoder who needs someone to speak
no, why you project allway all about what i am sometimes saying here to yourself ?
ah
what do you mean .. the still existend worldsituation ?
-> canibalic
really stupid is that kind of people what is thinking:
e.g. into -> propaganda to make people kill eachother!
(or like black and white .. you know)
stupid only is who allways make all -> true or false .)
for what ?
AH
what do you mean by "consider" ?
(also like little kind of "jam" it was .)
my old `nextPowerOfTwo` \o/ (was developing this sometimes here with friends into haxechat)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/IntUtil.hx>
anyway, i am also put the old tool from littleBigInt inside at now:
and it is still not -> in `logarithm` time 🙈 (not like the "originale" ;:)
(so -> math-optimization-problem was need to `solve`<-)
_A lgorithm S pice_
... if things going into complexity of
.. but for sure -> it was not `haxe` what didnt worked
(i am also really get stucky into same as last time ...
yeah
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/intern/TexUtils.hx#L119>
before i am rewrote it from the scratch for "nonPowerOfTwo" 😂 )
and i am was sitting yesterday and hour into front of that old one of codepiece ...
the old one i did together with <@272509832421179392>  but really long ago (and only for "powerOfTwo"-Textures)
-> <https://try.haxe.org/#C4F54F11>
last night i am also developed my new texture-slot-tiling algorithm (again 😂 [but without poweroftwo])
(<https://try.haxe.org/#62BC56dc>)
(i am was learning something new today)
`switch (abstract) ...`
like that with the
(any that the codingstyle looks khaotic sometimes to me .. its also how crazy using even the newst haxe-underrated features into all)
yeah, nanji is one of that old hardcorecoders i am like and feel with what he is doing
(even <:ceramic:925721673058095144> what e.g. i am personally never would touch .)

yeah -> ALL <- and not "any" 💕

be more discrete please ~~

like a "mini"-castle-DB ;:)
(and also _shadereditor_! [whenever you need!])
you already have your own LDTK
what i mean is
and no problem anymore to write also the extracted Bytes (or text into that case it no need to compress)
you only have to haxelibInstall `json2obj`
(where is link pls 🫂 ?)
also remember your old integrated `EDITOR`
eh -> all better then XML 🙈
cvs
then
csv
better

another
since so loooong time
to see
it is
`refreshing`
eh.. do you know how much
*LOL;:)
with many folders inside
tiles/
by the way ... i am really need a fully
(radio station .) ?~
what is that ?
(my special optimized versions also of all the tools .. e.g. without extra db-binds and all what never is need into neko or hl)
i am build haxe here by source!
no no ... if something not works ..
*LOL
no haxe wget or also no "legacy"-versions pls into the sandbox
oh no no no
(into playground-repo i mean [if it still is there some day!])
(i will fix them all to keep them online!)
aahh.. .yeah ... thats normal
e.g. look at <@215582414544699393> at now ... maybe he could need to make much faster and crosscompatible game :)
but i am will not forget again!
ok
then let it make work
(the whole folder -> as it IS! ;:)
w
o
n
hey... push it
oh, who did created the level ?
so maybe you are really not commited or i am only worked into a local-clonecopy here
i am sure also that i am deleted nothing from repo
me was really tryed it out also here and changed as i am remember
did we never had a "tiles" folder into playground ?
me also
?
you didn'T -> commit
ah yeah ...
(we should make "folder" for `LDTK` there -> 🌉 !)
but wonder where the last simple samplecode was get lost
hey, that one also supercool ...
(anyway.. i am liked the code ... where was it ?)
😭
fUCK
ah.. yeah..remember for `@santa` here
😢
yeah.. what folder was it ?
<@694560611601743893> or was it somewhere else where you uploaded it ?
somewhere you are used it to show how easy is to `import` data from that tool
remember you did it for someone (while gamejam)
Half, where is it 😅 (i am lost overview;:) <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground>
(i remember you was implementing it by sample there)
mhm, do we not also have LDTK-reader somewhere into peote-playground half ?
how do you wanna let it _walking_ (^_^)?

i am mostly like your main-char 5x7 \o/
you don't see it ?

fancy fiction ?

have not that `devices` here to play/test with

lines ? ;:)
where is your code ?
(and for everyone:)
(to make the old data -> `editable` again)
(and not wanna rewrite all your pipeline-scripts to make it happen)
and you can not edit your data anymore
sure ... but think about what effort will be if the "format" is changed sometimes
this is allways the easy part and only byte-juggling
that is easy i am think ( <@694560611601743893> i am remember did also sometimes wrote a loader for peote-view )
(i have my preferences;)
sure .. for pixel-art maybe "best" you find nowa
(only not using here for me cos have "angst" to can not use also into 10 years again with my old data)
ok, tiled is more for "FOCUS" ... what is ok (i am like also the simpletools)
woah, that fucking editor (i am only using Blender to have timestabletool)
mhm, do you interpolate between the overlapping tiles into grid ?
-> and `4` _embedding_ .) [if the host-language gives not enought of `trust` ~ ~]
scriptinglanguagefun if you wanna have it quick and dirty

yea.. cool stuff (remember that)

yeah, i am also only playing around (and all also only works since 3.75 or 4 i am think .. but thats ok ..
-> don't get _deflected_ by me cos of this little glitchythingy
hey NB .. or Logo ..
(especially if they are get -> `abstract` into queue ~^)
it have something todo with haxe and optional parameters .)
sure (i am would not post here if NOT ;:)
and wanna get easy :dive: in
if you call someone OTHERS little a p i
its only haxe->PARAMETER -> USABILITY
<@151104106973495296> if you are interested (i am not think 😂) i am also played around here tonight: <https://try.haxe.org/#9F4A1aE7>
but then all our samples would use more lines maybe and not also able to easy read by outer ones
<@694560611601743893> or i am also can make `fullyflexible` (nonhacky;:) by outsourcing the `automatic texture-slotTiling()` to the _userspace_
([more like 2-choices and one of them have sub-choise again ;:]) {->so the 🌳 i am wanna is only to -> `haptic usage` at most .. not have to be `balanced` i mean into _choosing_ .... -> wanna have it INTUITIVE\o/ at the end!])
(its not only a 2-choices problem i mean into API-usability)
wdyt?
looks more `coherent` then for my eyes (but <@694560611601743893> didn't `reviewed` yet ... so i am `unsure`)
```haxe
@:structInit
class TextureConfig
{
    // Slot-Resolution inside Texture... this will be only used if the "slots"-parameter
    // is not given while "new Texture(slotWidth, slotHeight, ?slots, ?textureConfig)"
    public var slotsX:Int = 1;
    public var slotsY:Int = 1;
//...
}
```
(my mind get stucky to much ... my last idea was this:
-> ANY *LOL
what even is optional
and not sure to make the amount of "slots" [to put all images into one texture for better handling]
(but this is "per texturedata [image]" for kind of _subtiling_)
-> simmiliar into _`naming`_ like is for TileX and TileY at now
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureConfig.hx>
My idea at now is to put the constructor-parameter "slots" into `TextureConfig` also
(like 5 loaded/generated images)
and if you e.g. set it to `5` .... you can store 5-TextureData inside of one OpenGL-BIG-Texture
(everywhere into API)
so now the "default" is -> 1 SLOT
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Texture.hx#L55>
and how i am `tile` it into -> `Slots`
its my old Texture.hx
for <@694560611601743893> and <@415825875146375168> (^_^)
what is best into -> usuability
into function parameter -> CONFIGURATION <-

mhm, wth SD gimme here (^_^) into `sequence`






<@896650877459374090>
to _know_ how it _works_
don't give _fucking up_ ;:) i mean
stay on !
<@903322370473852939> <@455699919450144768> can you `explain` pls to not get me totally _depressive_ :;) ?
(out of gameshit)
wonder what you all here put into haxe->c h a n
u2?
🙀
never `read a booK` do you ?
do you also haxe-programminglanguage-linguist ?
why do you -> show all `variations` ?
i am like to type it without order
what is problem ?
`haxe` or even `blender` it not hard to learn if you start it _slow_
[crazy .. at first i am _thought_ a blenderbug but was really only my own stupidness]~
_any_ -> `tab` key works again at now (i am really _trapped_ also into same like you <@694560611601743893> ...  😆 *hugs  )
not _changes_!
-> `256` frames <-
wtf -> anything is `7x7` NOW *LOL ;:)
<@694560611601743893> shortkey is `a` into `edit-mode` of that MESH -> (then `tab` works again)
no no ( its only need to dive into [no bug also into my "show grid"-hack .)->simple press `a` to select all "faces"]

same as me into pixel-by-pixel
oh, what do you using for -> `animation` then ?
what is your blender-version ?

(16x16 still -> _to much for me_ :)
i am will go back to 7x7 pixels-ENV at now .)
`CENTER` point .)
mhm.. the more i am `TRY` ... the more i am also thought about `15x15` to have a

do you are using the properit. stuff ?
adobe/flash/moai
and do you are involved there ?
ah, and why you like that ?
`7x5` also -> `option` (^_^)
(->[32x32] -> m a y be-<^~)
(i am should do same for 8x8 ,)
<:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
to get it _animated_ 💕
even for simple 16x16 element-texture-tile
ohoh .. how long would it need to fill all the 256x256 pixels
adios
really _flexible_.
(how it is mapped)
Also you can change the UV-quad-ORDER or anything ;)
(so totally-hacky-queues can be supereasy get constructed)
and what this is rendering will be the IMAGE :)
hey, you know .. i am can also create a new "scene" into that .blend-file
not sure about yet (tryed to disable also all for best into 2D)
problem only .. the eevy renderer maybe did all a bit darker into preview
and all is orthogonal
by a blender -> "driver" <-  what i am put into x and y there of "position" ;:)
the camera is moving automatically
yeah
now set a start end end-frame
\o/
sry, did it maybe not into the file i am was send
switch that flags!

Ahhh
oh, you can disable
where ? 👁️ ?
(maybe one post into blenderartists-forum and tomorrow someone helps us!)
yes .. sorry that i am not found it at first try (long ago i am painted there)
to use into peote-view 16x16
Anyway, the cool is that we only have to save the image at the end .)
(yeah, animation->next time!)
🌅
🌊
🫂
mhm.. or is also the "stroke" settings then are need
yeah
do you tryed also out the -> `sharper` default (instead of "custom")
(and later all can be collapsed into menu there and only -> custom color-palette-selector!)
it is only this!

yeah... i am did mistake by the "falloff"-`curve`
\o/
💧
COOL ->
(to see how it looks later into peote-view by `smoothing` - parameters on/off ;:)

you can do also things like this:
(turned it off now for the "starter"-tpl _.tmpl_ :;)
(i am only let it `enabled` to make some _annotations_ later .)
ther you can turn off ALL overlays

is using background color
+ control key
(only that you see more into upper right ... of "edit-mode" ... that can be easy get hide also!)
mhm.... not sure ... here it is working also while playing
(but not sure that it is the version)
do you also have 4.0.2 ?

sure
😢
yeah, and the cool is .. you also see the grid then into image-editor (the great painting-canvas!)
camera and grid
you have only 2 objects into scene
(click on it!)
(into scene collection on bottom little area)
is your `grid` selected ?
(my little shorthack)
grid is turning on/off by pressing `tab` key
(but some are also -> GLOBAL ;)
(every viewarea-context have its own shortkeys)
(while your mousepointer is over that views ... all is "virwmode"-contextintensive .. where your mouse is over!)
you have to set the 2 views into -> life-rendermode by press and hold "z"key °
i am was reducing all to really -> minimum (the last 5h ;:)
or do you see the timeline .. there are also 2 shortkeys to set start and end-animation by where the framepointer is
press space button
\o/
yeah, pls finalize the "falloff" for me :)
-> emulate 3 button mouse

(and the shift, ctrl or alt... can be also all customized)
on linux sometimes also both mouse-buttons together
mhm.... moment ... you can also look into "preferences" there ...
but how is -> shift
ah yeah
+/- keys there also work for zoom
or do you mean to navigate the view ? ... do you have numpad keys on keyboard ?
"z" while pointer is over the 3d-view (the 2 cam views into top-right)
i am optimized also all for your old machine .)
(mousewheel -> zoom in ... press middle mousebutton you can shift inside image-editor)
Half, by cursor left right you can go one frame back or forward

at first you have todo this i am think (after re-open here also)
<@694560611601743893>

ah, foudn it ... -> the brush->Falloff
there is not only 1 pixel ;) .-... wtf .... m o m e n t o

mhmm... but the brush isnt perfect ... moment
space key start/stops animation (and tab bring into edit-mode so you also see the uv-grid _helperhack_ ;)
so you only need to press tab or space (and zoom shift by mouse into image-editor )
oh, by mouse the brush also is hard .. it was my little-graphictablets-presure only

no, like this:
is already by pressing tabulator key only
Wanna try 😍 ?
not hard enough
mhm, the brush is not optimal yet ;:)

ok, lets try a little first test .... 😂 .... momento
i mean... 90% is prepared into blender->special-ui-layout for .) [and some drivers to paint while it is into animation!]
(-> movie *lol ;)
<@694560611601743893> i did it tonight (for next step after mypaint ;)
(ah... i am also really should save the uv-grid ... then load it into image-editor there ... yeah :)
mhm, forgot the shortkey to clear the uv mapped image 😅

i ve created little spritesheet editor (16x16) for max 255 animframes

into science-work you know you allways have to point to your sources!
```
LAION datasets are simply indexes to the internet, i.e. lists of URLs to the original images together with the ALT texts found linked to those images. While we downloaded and calculated CLIP embeddings of the pictures to compute similarity scores between pictures and texts, we subsequently discarded all the photos. Any researcher using the datasets must reconstruct the images data by downloading the subset they are interested in. For this purpose, we suggest the img2dataset tool.```

into _haxecoding_
invite our little `jams`
gimme code then!
without any line of haxecode!
there you can realize all your visions
you should go into armory3d then

and need of ->
at end all is -> `overlap` at least *lol
don'T ask me why "HIT" 🙈 (into "namespace")
[e.g to use the `mipmap`-`levels` of gpu-spice into `quicksearch`]
-> needs a `try` (^_^)
is can handle them all at once (some day ;)
George: for me i am near to give up into that .. maybe the parallele power of GPU nowadays
(maybe there could be do by better -> _optimization_-ALGORITHM)
(i mean -> all have same -> `tilesize` ... and no tiles inbetween like that `tetris`-combination ones)
(e.g. all tiles of map or background or any "hit"[lol]-area inWolfed ;:)
(if there all is into -> `rasterization`)
i am think some looking for better _"optimization"_ instead of using OpenGL-PICK->old-technique
(or haxelib install quadtree ;:)
yeah, for this is box2d, nape or echo for!
(cos so much "@noCompletion"-decorations)
(seems to me -> "IDE"->orientated)

np, i am only name-fetishist
(and only multiple avatars)
oh, i am thought you are the same one
<@369949680081174538> how long do you think you need to be fully profi into learning and using the haxe-programming-spice ?
+ `haxe`
in _rythm_ and _sync_
(->will be not the same as the original anymore -> TOTALLY <- new way of _solving_ then!)
(but if i am do it alone ... you know -> `fully random` :;-)
i am really wanna port it also by my pure lime renderer sometimes

and how can i am ->  `test` ?

that i am can -> `compile` them later !
for me the best into hscript is ,
\o/ YEAH
mhm, why not try -> hscript ?

woah -> F u N k IE ;:)
scratch is really cool ... you should try Armory3d also then into next (of logic-brick/node coding!)
then show me your `lua` code ( i am also used it sometimes ago! )

any what you do ... pls try to stay into -> `communication` with me
so java ? (into minecraft namespacestyle?)
long into ?
so
think
you
do
why
(out of fuckingenglish)
what is the language you are BEST into ?
oh, into lua you are a good programmer ?
?=?
what is your `main` lang
ah, but what into universe then put you here into our little haxe-programminglanguageCHAT ?
_simple_ `logic` editor!
can `build` a holy transistor `by`
for me minecraft mechanix is also kind of -> `turing band`
(so for what do you are using `haxe` there?)
Rudy: and `combine`
i am more one of the ones who like to -> `build` <-
Rudy, what do you build all great stuff by that cool edit tool ?
not sure how is into -> game-save `format` nowadays (that they can load same buildings and code)
i mean, i have some friends ... into 20 years ago they build -> WORLDs into !
(into artwork)
How much do you build up into minecraft what needs to safe for the next generations ?
and i am also like `valheim` ... there you also can build up things
i am started playing Baldurs Gate (the remake by cool company who did also wrote divine divinity)
what .. do you are NOT using `haxe` -> shame on you 😂 ;:) ~~
why do you using haxe to generate javacode for ? (is it better into `strictyness` then `? .. i mean for mc )
a ha
(or the `non branded` old versionbranch ?)
ahh.. minecraft .. that microsoft ones ?
what for ?
( <@694560611601743893> -> <http://maitag.de/semmi/stable-diffusion/forWolfgang/> ;:)

-> a

And i am really need to code something senseful into application
Anyway .. all is thousand times better at now and i am think is is near to `1.0`
before did a full `rewrite`
cos there at that time i am also did get stuck into
for `Texture` i didn't had something into peote-view 1 (the first prototype)

(have to put my old ascii also into peote-view remastered at now !)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-origin/blob/master/Source/peote/view/PeoteView.hx#L5>
yeah, i am really need no more

`best base` into graphics and haxe
so pure Lime was (and is) -> perfect for ME
(to let the old codebases also run into more environments)
to keep all supercompatible also to let run the old work of eachone!
NotBilly: and NME and OpenFL at that time for me was to much blocked by old swf->Components/MCs
i am was feeled at that time to need more pure GL (after all that Sprite-engines ;)

(now you know why i am was choosing that name ;:)*lol
*LOL
oh, and the cold potatoe-salad ( + viennese sausages )
only mashed potatoes with little snippeds of 🥒
that was also -> some kind of `default`-meat from my childhood
(cured/smoke)
~10 cm long

(little fishs what you can eat also with head and all into once)
we also put some `Sprotten` on the table
😂
the culinaric-variations isnt so much here ....
*lol
and best the dessert -> Klötensuppe ;)
my wife was cooking something other ...
ah (sry)
yeah
.. i am was cooking "Eintopf" .)
(the "Theme" was -> "regional" dish from taste ... so what also the grandma was cooked
(was showing my new neighbour my computerstuff on its mobiles .)
here was fullhouse-party today ... where every party is cooking something
HEY -> S O U N D \o/

(fuckshitAtjob 🥹 ?)
oh, what was distracting you ?
(while painting i mean)
(but into little window byside -> see how is into animation all the time!)
(like you edit a complete spritesheet inside of blender into image-editor)
not wanna set up a complete `armature` ... only a quad-strip with UV-map (to paint in and then let the cam move into animation)
our last .ora sharing was inspiring me to try out same into blender with animation (16x16)

how do you think this <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/net/multipaint>
can be easy extend to be a -> `rythm game` ~^ ?
(all the graphic-assets is already there .)

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/texture/assets/peote_font.png>
no no (not with peote-view)
from some people here i am wish:  rythm-game->prototype (supersimple one!)
->without a good usecase i mean -> senseless ;:)
Need also someone who helps me to make -> `targetspecific` optimization-ready.
and together with the `graphics` spice
cos into some of years ... i am maybe only will looking there ( or to keep all haxecode up to date there )
e.g. into `peote-playground` here -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground>
For sure ... better would be another `simple sample` to test out (like a `template` into that case!)
i am only like that he usey my little bigInt lib sometimes ( even if into `private` repo ~_-)

write a sample, and i am will `give my respect`

<:lime:567735656361492490>
think about!
only if you install `lime`
(cos of namespace-changings overlast time)
<@694560611601743893> also no one other is using our lib .. or do you know someone ;:) ?
[have some friends who is really `4K` -> fetishist]
can be also only 4 Kilos of `Bytes` ;:)
and if you let _build it down_ at the end .. via hashlink->c at the end
-> into absolute `minimalism` of artstyle 🙂
(not directly the `physics` behind but how the char is _moving_  and its `tile` is _changing ...
while jumping against the wall!)
-> this is `cool stuff` <- by my eyes!
you have to implement a simple game-engine by my renderer at first! (for only "sonic"-kind-of-games)
(on OpenGL -> ES2/3 side to make fully -> `crosscompatible`!)
to much _effort_
What i am not wanna do is `index-color-formats` <@694560611601743893> ... there is would need
(for png .)
(there is more `spice` inside since some years at now!)
we need sample also how to load by pure `format` lib !
(therefor the `TextureDate` men in the middle since last year!)
yeah, lime tools only gives us RGBA or RGB
[at float or not float->`precision`]
e.g. you only wanna use a grayscale-png format ... so only 1 [8bit uint8]`channel`! ;:)

mhm, i am think something is wrong with my tablet here or latest mypaint-version:
(the server then need to migrate to haxe 4 .)
TurboStone is also `multiuser` ~^
ANY WAY ... HALF, i am only start a new multipainting-session after
so it need a kind of `pen-cache` on client-side (or best all into `layer`!)
(the origin is show more how is into fully realtime-networking .. not into paint!)
multipaint need to -> redesign <- from kind or `network`!

(maybe win10 thinks it is -> `its own "touch"-event` 🙈 ... all much more worse than into win7)

WOAHAHA \o/ *hugs .... YEAH!!!!!!!
Wanna see your `painting` intoAction.
to _send me back_ <:blobenjoy:964545740619808859>
<@729181341182066749> can you also make some -> screen-video-capture <- ?



mhmmmm
or paint some urchins .) !
why not code a little try.haxe snippet to come on better ideas into mind ...
mhm
ah ..sry.. i am missunderstanding then (you have to know.. i am have to translate all here manually!)
opera *lol ;:)
what kind of _family soup_ ?
whatWasIT ?
B A S E
(at now also "layout"-lib is optional [ and this is also depends on `pure jasper haxelib`! ], 
 -> i am think input2action and peote-text also should be "optional" ... will do that at _end_!!)
Logo, you know, all is `constructed` from bottom to up 😂
```
        ___ peote-ui ____ 
        /        |      \
  peote-text     |       \
      /          |        \
peote-view       |         \
    /            |          \
L I M E    peote-layout  input2action

    H       A        X        E 
```
(also "texture-type"s needs more features [at now only RGBA 🙈] to make all more optimized also for `peote-text` rendering)
have to rewrite the "texture-filtering" part at first inside of `peote-view` base layer
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/fonts/
<http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/textrendering/>
no, all is rendered by `peote-view` and _glyphes_ + _shader_
( also all would depend on  `peote-text` lib and there i am have some on my todo also what needs its time to _finalize_ ! )
i am don't think that <@385014891750096896> or me wanan write a `backend` before i am not put all into haxelib-repo soon ! (so to only write that once and it still will working for many years without any more effort .)
(keep a later "undobuffer" also into mind!)
(and `yeah` ,,, also to easy zoom in/out by mousewheel ... on top .)
with grid and snapping `zoom` i am think it have to be better (after trying again 😂 now)

aah (for what kind of applicationlogic/type?)
oh REALLY 🤩 \o/ ?
(with `pure` _intersection_ and gravityconstraining)
(my last cool echo-sample was to long ago: http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/echo-gravityOnIntersect/ ~_~)
<@219159860955054081> need a supersimple startercode of `verlet` now ... would be really interesting how to get it into some kind of _sync_ to `echos bodyphysics` <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
(i am need some one who helps me to get out of `spiral` there *lol ;:)
<@694560611601743893> and what do you are working on at moment 🙂 ?
what do you mostly using `it` for ?
(or maybe can be used also for some kind of special "menu" into ui)
me to... but cool for demos also and other programming->artOfStuff!
did you ever tryed ?
because you sayed: "to hard"
oh sorry, i didn'T knowed
by the way, do you also used echo-`verlet` somewhere into ceramic yet ?
you could make a screenshot of your code-editor at _best moment into ;)_
aahhh (k)
sry, what is a "pfp" ?
don't give up!
Half, into gravity sample there it also did something _simmiliar_ on top of the `echo`-basics ... but there is also totally no  `collosion` .. so anyway ... it needs m o r e 😂
(or also to let them "rotate"-constrained by angle-stuff!)
(e.g. to make 100 .. where allways 2 to 5 is constrained by distancejoints)
(only circle shapes ... that alone will be much fun later then!)
yeah, pls lets do this into "playground" !!! (wanna also use the electric-bold-lines !!! to visualize the distance-ones 😍)
(and after rigid-body-calculation also the `verlet` once have to be -> adjusted again <- into _some way_ <:blobidea:964199768039510067>?)
my idea is to let run then allways the `verlet`-sim at first ... and then every position-change is a _directional force_ to each involved echo-body
and into `next step` then both together (2 simple spheres what is connected by distance-joint)
<@694560611601743893> should we have some really simple pure `verlet`sample there at first ?
My Question at now is 😅  -> HOW to COMBINE them BOTH (original echo-`rigid body`-physic + new `Verlet`-one [into "simmulation"])
( the last sample here: <https://austineast.dev/echo/> ..so press "previous"-button to see!)
and <@694560611601743893> pointed me to new stuff into there -> called `Verlet` simmulation
<@456226577798135808> programming also have to make fun while coding ... e.g. i am really wanna write more "echo" physic samples into our little playground here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/blob/master/echo/simple/src/Main.hx#L59>

<@694560611601743893> sometimes i am also thinking about now how to make an "rythmgame"-sample there .. e.g. by `arrow`-shader + soundgeneration.)
(with lesser codelines [and _acceptable performance_!];)
any, i am really wanna see the same into <:flixel:230369617774641152> or <:ceramic:925721673058095144> .)
(will concentrate also [after peote-view is into haxelib!] more on peote-text mid-term-lib&tools!)
(especially all the texture-params .... that will be better into -> `0.91`!!!)
(ui-code still blows up to much there .,... anyway ... it works ;:)
anyway, i am also happy still at now that the logic-code there is still much lower than the `config-stuff` (into _amoutOfLinecount_)
so by only ~`3` more lines of computercode.
(so like all what is at now into code -> but `twice` instanciated.)
and another -> FBO -> "render2texture" into -> QUEUE
-> to the other direction)
(cos more easy then to let it `rotate` by _textureshifting_

OH.. cool ... than `22` is really GOOD!!!! 💓
22 ... total amount of jammers ?
pls ... what was it after voting? (i am not _follow_ that _channels_ on webpage there ~~)
on the `itch`-strawberry-hill (^_~

<@694560611601743893> apropos, what was you place into last game-jam (samurai!)
also _easy_ to _use_ ?
for little  `jamS` ;)?
is `ceramic` also have a _playground_ <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> ?
<@151104106973495296> what do you are using Ceramic-engine for ?
(or do you speak about ceramic? .. i am never used!)
where do you are using such `backend`stuff elsewhere?
its working so long `superstable` on linux i mean (and can direct config my `lime` for!)
`fbdevice` is my _faforite_ into all of that!
(or things like -> "direct" -> Framebuffer!)
(also i am like open-gl ... and not that microsoft-only-stuff!)
😂
i had to learn at first what all that is
wtf
(or more going back to my old perl 5 workflow .)
yeah, also sometimes thought about to using `processing` only
-> not "stable" (or "crossstable" )then!
🙈
(to much _effort_)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/openfl>
i am also like the lime-tools i mean (separately!)
would "peote-view" exists without lime?
into `haxelib` all is _cool_ !
anyway, its only -> "git"-web-"hub" shit
all only -> haxelib!
yes, "lime" also can be the `root` for more out of openfl->flixel
i mean, i am like if software is _organized_ into `layers` 🌳
🤣
into the psyco-branch
at least at the moment where Flixel _float_ into -> FNF-repo fully *LOL
(if not i would do a bountybranch)
sure
at now i am can live with that ... i mean that there is no separate comforted `haxelime` repo anymore into github!
only at the moment it will be integrated into <:flixel:230369617774641152> (after they now integrated haxelime-repo into <:openfl:567735656017821708> .. i am not 100% sure anymore .)
could even put all of them now into my own haxe-graphics-framework ... BUT ... ->
i am happy .. that stuff like this is now totally easy by peote-view (+ libs on top) to -> combine <-
*lol
(can you also implement my spiral-input-textfield 😂 ?)
cool
is that also fully crosstargetplatform ?
never used  ceramic or pixie or something other
ah ... thats crazygood huge stuff also !
*hugs
\o/ yeah .. thank you!
(the old peote-view lib one really was need ... it was _prehistoric_ before 😂 !)
Or do you did all into best _naming_ and  code-structure from the beginning ?
refactor into files and folder `namespaces` and structure also ?=
anyway, how is into haxebot-code ... do you also need to
( iam will _remind_ -> manually ;:)
*LOL
`/edit reminder 0 durationTime-=5h`
how can i am fix it from disco-inputline here ;:)?
Half, do you also have something (out of Texture) what need to be more:
`coherent` into API before `v1.0` ?
with good `Synaptic` for the: View, Display, Program, Buffer<Element> and Element
-> `taxonomy` there 🙂
yeah, better only pure api for peote-view ... and more Readmes
(<api.haxe.org>)
anyway.. also like the : "See also"-links there at now!
mhm.. where was i am seen that last time ...
i mean that new commenting there at bottom at now (like into old AS3-doc 👍 )
What i am totally like is to have -> user-samples there like into haxe-dox-site
yes (jquery only on need! ... also css have to be simple as possible)
we should use a good html-dox-template from one of the other haxegurus!
no no
y..me to
do you was sometimes checked out the old DOX-script ?
all the .hx into peote.view.* should have inline-doc (wanna complete that for API!)
So now it is at `0.9.0` ... not long and api is `final` :) \o/
(for playground i will do later ... also all needs better TextureConfiguration-Spice at next session)
core-sample-repo also `migrated`!
(  🧹 -> 🛸 ;:)

see you (only mean i am liked your last one also into -> SND!!!)
for the last `haxe`  game on itch-session ,.)

<@694560611601743893> https://youtu.be/3xHG7wSdtF0?t=572
https://youtu.be/1ok1ChTtWQI?t=3
YEAH \o/
keep it
think about...
take your time ....
most i am was liked the sound->pointeffects
remembers me into sex-pistol-song -> "no future"
mhm ... pls tell me your longtermplans .)!!! -> now!
and _thinking_ (^_´)
hey, feel free into your DOING
( -> my README is your README <@694560611601743893> )
( i mean a simple commit to readmy i am also much like !  😍 )
🌉
then "link" it -> `in`! (between the "Readme"s!)
-> put into playground
wanna show it also to my master-of-constraints <@689869574883246237> (supercrazy using into armory3d for demos there 💓)
for me important is -> simple `reprocucable` sample into simpleGFXplayground
(i will make _variations_ then!!!)
also any simple starter!!!!!
hey..pls put into peote-playground!
yeah ... that really is -> NEEED
AAAHHH
"verlet" ?
my _faforite_ is this one: http://maitag.de/~half/2024/walkcycle-with-variations/
http://maitag.de/~half/2023/bulby-tiles/
(hey, but that "shapes" one there .. that is _my one_ only copyed ;:)
what was last time do you was trying to rebuild "turbostone" ?
http://maitag.de/~half/2023/
(old constructings)
(and file/folder <-> package|module)
into one of my superold codelines 😅
🧹
->
PEN
great-sized
and also need to use the
at m o m e n t
me to -> `PLAY GROUND`
crossplatform
to get it `run`
haxe isnt "dirty" -> dirty is if have to put some "hack" inside
(to solve into a short amount of time .)
for better -> game -> I D E A S ;:)
i am think you need more RELAX-time
4rd -> "moment .... need to dive into my old code there;:)"
or is something `INCOHERENT` into API ?
do you was need any `dirty hacks` `?
i mean into `haxe` -> language <- of my samplespace
no no ... not the REAL one .)
and the END
that -> targetspecificshit
yeah, but that not have to affect the PROGRAMMER
Also my hundrets of peote-view samples at now have -> to be -> reduced (into code-style!)
into -> `userspace`
i am really not like to make target-specific-`hacks` at the end
( and for snd it is not running `multiplatform` 😭 )
Halfwheat, my old plan is still the same:
`formula` -> graphic
`formula`-> sound waves
(into toolchainset -> `IntMap<Tool>`.)
yes, better concentrate on all what is there and is stable working
so no "code-comforting" into my opinion is there
(maybe that was only -> _summer of code_ or they are not work there anymore)
did not put more samples into
also after a year at now
but the google developers there ...
me have
(who have the experience?)
but who should do it .. out of us ?
also doesn't helped me much.
anyway, pure web-js and audio-"lets" ;) -> worklets
(to make web-compatible)
at the Rust->WASM part
where we both was -> give up
(if you remember into -> snd-generation-by-CHUNK-sizes!)
(wasm)
sure
(sound-playing should have same performance as graphic into hardcore-optimization and target-compatibility!)
graphic lib + input + sound
(more easy to use for next demo/jamsession)
or to make .-> _`interoperable`_
i mean we could combine our  `haxelibs` then
(e.g. for lime-better-compatible->easytouse -> SND-lib)
not until you wrote own lib for all
hey, if you using other libs -> you should ! ( -> run the _tests_! )
mhmmmmmm ghmmmmmm GmHmmmm
( anyFromWhere its _installable_)
(before `1.0)`
no no, i mean into -> `versionizingprocess`
😆
(all that wat is not still `manifested` into haxelib-holygrailrailrepopkg)
to find the (not allways "shorts")
WAY .)
-> `Graph<T>` i mean <-
-> and not the ADT ;:) (the abstract fundamental DATATYPE ;:)
i am was really sad that there is already a `Graph` one
last time i am looked into haxelib (by search command)
🐜
(^~)
time is import
sure ->
toMakeAnyShortChallenge
not sure we need <@231872730478280705> s -> organization->TALENT-skill or something
4theBAND ;:)
<@694560611601743893> where is next haxe _game JAM_ DEMO-session ?
<@215582414544699393> how long is ago you _started_ code something into `haxe` <:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218> <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> <:blobidea:964199768039510067>

(for the _default_ STRING into SPIRAL sample vari)
much as possible words by URL-parameter ... idea ?
really thought about how to `pack` a-z into base64 to have at

(into editing the playground-trails ^_^)
<@694560611601743893> do you `listen` oneIsComming `?

woah, why not let make a `bunch of images`

<@729181341182066749> or `luigi` to 👹 ?
`mario`-> _maffia_ ?
\- -
more and more
nah, as what you posting here i am really
<@729181341182066749> how much they `pay` to you ?
(or `get` payed _by_ ?)
so you are really `payed` by _nintendo_ for this ?
(cool collage)

<@729181341182066749> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace


put it into a very long line and _commit_ the `png` to here then to add a new `variation` : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/shaders/uv/fosterWallaceSpiral/assets> (only dfWallice is booring i mean -> wanna have `endless fun` ;:)
(hey, "minecraft nowadays" i am also only would run into a super-secure-container-emulator!)
`pathfinding`-algorithm ?
or also for good samples to show to everyone ?
Do you only need for -> OWNgame ?
to `paint` into for `wb` (whiteboard.)
if no X-graphic display is need
did that often (but only into my old perl-terminal-times .)
i am prefare to use ansi-style and protocol there `pure` (without ncurselib on top of)
you also can bind the lib to pure haxe for sure (much better if only need there purely)
since 3 or 5 years or so .. i am forgot
sure
(not tested by myself yet into terminal)
haxe and pure ncurses works as i am know
"pd" -> public domain ?
( spile , can you also link me up to your git-stuff to see what the goal is ~_~ [was to long into my subcode here 🤿 ] )
what did Leah implemented ?
who was that ?
ony a _bit_ more then a `term`
its only a ->  `protocol`
`superEASYstable`-stuff!
x11 is old unix
x11 is the best (you can also export display to another computer by telnet/ssh really easy!)
what is not working by hxcpp buildchain for linux ?

-> needs a simple `lime rebuld linux` before!
(linuxonly)
(to let it run without X)
in lime iam can change the SDL-config also to use direclty the fbdevice
can only help into `lime` there
(also a bit like a pendulum (with _damping_-param!)
the more letters on the  `right` side while writing .. the more it have to rotate to make -> `balance` - simmulation
i mean -> supercool would be to integtrate some kind of gravity-`physic`
mhmmm ... or should the  `spiralrotation` been -> _elastic_ ... woah .. that would be amazing also ... -> the faster you type .. the faster its `rotatescrolls` it should be _allow_ ! (to use as little _word_ memetool here ;:)
and then all by peote-net for 2 player `direct-chat` (like the old unix `write/tell` commands)
nah, really fun will be later by using 2 spirals into >< orders .)
the `word input spiral` really helps me to write -> _slow_ 😂

<@694560611601743893> do you still make a `variation` 😍 of the `demo` sample `?

welcome into the `club` (^_^)
to make life better .)
or no more `power` for
no courage to try out something new .)
so someofthat i would say)
the old-mass is maybe from nature -> more "conservative" ( not into political-party i mean ... also -> to "keep things running what was run before"
(to much information on brain all the time [e.g. by mobile little input ;)])
yeah, maybe young people also have -> informationoverdrive
(for own _short_ profit)
at that time
what did put that shit into rolling
it was only some one -> propaganda-influencer <-
yes, but the people of uk (the most of) don'T want to be -> island monkey <- again i am think :;)
(multiculture black hole .)
yeah, great cosmo town
( the old/new _fashists_ parties here also wanna -> `dexit` 🙈 ,,, what the stupid ... 😢 💧 )
berlin is cool town here also ! (not all parts --.-- anymore ...-_-)
cool town! (only that the pubs have to close at 11 i am was hated .)
was one day into london into 1990
ne of germany
\o/ sex pistols :)
COOL
oh, you are from great britania ?
(last weeks)
(was listening something about into radio)
mhm.. is into EU zone not yet apple-company have to allow more out-house-apps also ?
cool (if it is not "metal" onlysupport -> peote-view should run there same as on android!)
oh, do you have sucha device `? (mac and iphone?) ... cos can not test my stuff there 😢
(some times "BE" here can stand for _any_ thing into my mind .)
*hugs
np
ah, key *hugs
(back-end?)
what is "BE" shortkey for ?
that would be best (to tail the log or something .) ... (or the latest haxe git comments)
(there was some lime-glitches i am still need to hack the HTML5Window.hx there)
sry... *lol (need to test out that copy paste also works ;)

by a long url
so we can send some messages (word-memes*LOL ;:) -> into WORLD
and also to let rotate another spiral inside into other direction .)
i am think about to give some default-text by url-parameters (only for html5-spiralshowreel ;:)
(same font-glyphes also ;:)
(also all run the same on neko, hashlink, android, hxcpp)
but its pure haxe -> crosstarget
no (in html-target its gl-context also inside of gl-canvas there)
yeah.. more to let more easy use OpenGL (limes gl es-context) for 2d-only-quads ;)
no, it have othing todo with openfl
peote-view is pure 2d opengl lime based `render`-lib
here to test: http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/uiTextlineSpiralUVmapped/
here it is: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/shaders/uv/uiTextlineSpiral>
ok, moment
have some bug maybe ... into "mousewheel" 😅 .. should i am upload into playgroudn ?
<@694560611601743893> did some new experiment 😂 :

sure (but this would be _another story_ .)
what is rotating the textflow reverse
what needs is another spiral inside
exactly
*LOL
ivy is what is need ;)
uv
( cos only -> _shrinking_ is not enough)
( iam think i need to render another UVmapped SPIRAL then by blender )
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/tree/master/shaders/uv>
<@694560611601743893> i am really need to make it also rotate into the other direction _inside_ ;:) [to let `read` also on non-`sub`moduleLVL ;:)]
povray.org
anyway, need also little nap at now,     adios ... bad bunny *lol

(so booring into texturing)
i am like to swim and dive into pure haxelime water
to easy _reassemble_ its own -> _fanfiction_ ;:)°!

can haxedoom also read md2? (i forget)

`first try` (first question to the oracle of delphi *LOL ;:) ->
<@215582414544699393> sry if you also hate that new shit .. but for me it have something -> oracle like

to let see what my diffusestable Model -> `OUT`
or should i am use automatically `alory, ivan, carolina` for you (or the old urchin ?)
<@729181341182066749> what do you think of new `keyword` for that image could be ?
-> _puts it out of randomentropy_
only the `point of MOMENT` you `look at`
Sometimes i am think its like into `quantum mechanics`
<@694560611601743893>

😂


woah ... 😭 .... now only that keywords pure:
(my `LOCAL` one here *lol ;:)
as if the artificial one would know you <@215582414544699393> :-)
(and this on the first TRY)
yeah, i am like it

ok -> `cypher` is the nXtOne

now with the `sign` image

i am interested into your unique graphicstyle

problem?
`ANYthingISaFILE`!
yep (but not on my `LOCAL ENV here .)`)=
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view?#samples>
no no no -> i am was put a link to the samplespace inside
only the `core` lib is much more _slim_ at now (more space for `documentation` ;:)
hey, np
or do you was using while jamchallenge ?
not also -> before *LOL ;)?
oh, i am also put all from `assets/image` into `assets` only
🦒 i am really only changed all `names` by hand ... not tested out any into-> `run`
or `CLONE` a new _instance_ :)
-> `MERGE` i t !
kEy
after i did a (was really need .:~) -> `rename`
apropos .. what is into your github-fork
i mean the line into peote-playground new stuff!!!!
link!
pls post me (all browsers are still closed here at now)
?° ?^?° ?°
and where was it .... *loookingSearcheful
who was need that into origin ?
you did that not for me as i am remember
but remember (we have it also into play-ground ;:)
ldtk i am never used yet
oh shit
(some of them last time i ve seen also into haxe at now)
that ones from polygonal ?
What if that data only would be an Uint8-array also for lvl-data ?
and `check` from there ?
Array<Arrray<?>> ?
so you have all your static level-walls into great Array ?
using GPU-power°!°
(and the `static` "world"-lvl-elements are all 32x32`px`)
(also if you char have e.g 64x64`px`)
no, to test if there is a `wall` or `free space` to walk with your _char_ into
no no -> no `caching`-downer ~_
to render into 255x255 Uint8array to use for `collosions-check`
wanna make a new sample what shows how to use the same `buffer<Element> of elements`
32x32 pixel `quad`
lets say .. you have 255 x 255 elements into your `buffer`
wanna try to render out more into textures (framebuffers into queue)
(not into micro-management or something ... i am think its the old -> milk ... engina ...what comes backIntoMyMind more and more like everyear is Spring is NEAR;:)
i am fully back on -> `optimization trip` .... at now ~ _ ^°
(that `gong` .)
i am feel -> S N D
eh, let us make something `together`
*lol
Half, i am happy if you are happy (for next JAM i mean 💓 + 🛠️ )
thank you
anyway, armory is really a good tool to make things into 3d-visualization (+simplelogic!) -> superfast into creation if you do it 2 or 3 times (really easy to learn i mean)
yeah, for older programmers like us it feels like 🍝 for sure
with blender!
pure 2d
you can `rig` also into finite-pixelspace
Half, you are really should use more blender and armory also ❣️ (->totally awesome also!!!)
and start a `new` one (^_^)
or you let is as it is
(also out of `itch`<-outerFRAMEing)
(then i am not need to->bookmark<- and will find by myself 😂 )
http://maitag.de/~half/2024/
pls simple put html/bin to here sometimes (do not forget!)
this is need also 🧹 =?
(put it on maitag also!)
no stress
\o/
did i forget to bookmark =
what was name and where is your game-jam-code ?
by the way
also no hxml ?
(text.hx)
(and also only 1 file)
(its still complete and best tool for me into 2 usecases yet)
(hxp will never change so much i am sure)
yes, exaclty this is my fear
but it have to be comforted by you then also for the next 20 or 50 or more of years!
lets `use` it!
(into extending the old hxp-supertool by some new spice)
im only mean: time to traverse the directory .)
yep, but now all the samples is into folders and subfolders
(->  `hxp buildall html5` would be good for showcase)
(or  `hxp build bunnymark html5` for CI)
`hxp test bunnymark hlc`
yeah
sure -- > but wanna test easy out also all `TARGETS` here locally on my computer!
\o/
any -> for me the most _elegant_ way would be by `h x p` °°°
hey, not that i am have to send you new samplecode by _bird_ sometimes ;:)
🙀 🪛
(and also into as3 ~~)
(i did that sometimes into the as3-haxeport ;:)
`away3d` supports this as i am remember
(but it need to dive deeper into filesystem recursively and filter out all .hx files what contains the regexp for the class what `extend Application` -> then only cmd: `hxp list` to show them all and how sorted into `foldertree`!)
<@694560611601743893> do build all peote-view samples (and "playground";:) -> we need at least some spice like here: <https://github.com/maitag/formula/blob/master/test.hx#L54>
do you sure on other side is no chess-program 😂 ?
together with `snd` it only helps to get that _imersione-feeling_ (like if you read a book or look into the worldwide ->photo/meme/any-album ;:)
also the `graphic` is not the most important into a `good game`
<@729181341182066749> but REMEMBER 😂 : the origin urchin-game also was into `2D` at first (by the _superfastestscrollingtechniqueEVER_!)
(and if you like `building` you also will _find_ your fun there 🙂 into !)
if you more like graphics instead of programming then i am only can recommend to you to use <:armory3d:567770954126852096>
(try -> out)
at now its loose ordered only ;) -> <https://github.com/maitag/armory-3d-land>
some day if i am go back to 3d i am will put my own armory-samples also inside there
(its more than i have for peote-view)
last time i am tryed out most of this ones: <https://github.com/armory3d/armory_examples>
is there samples do you can try out?
also better than before (there was  `n o t h i n g into Readme -_-`
*hugs half .. thank you 💕
exactly (loose sounds like .>looser :;)
😆
how is now? <https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground/commits/master/> 😅
moment. .... (will commit)
to show what it is ... i am know now
no no .. there need some adj. languagesugar!
what adjective do you would use ?
maybe i mean: "incoherent" then ... mhmmmmm ... ~^ ? 😂
ah, then into english languages its maybe different meaning ?
(of creation)
(what need at moment)
or other stuff byside
sure, but also using other libs there
or into any order
loose means not only "peote"
ah, double `o` `?
wtf
😂
oh.. did i made translation-mistake ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-playground?#peote-playground>
and not into -> `playground`
more "benchs" also should be there ...
.. so feel free to add some ones also if you need!
but now there can be more -> Test-Images also for sure ...
anyway... its good to use same as into opengl-bunnymark
or should we make our own there ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples/blob/main/texture/assets/wabbit_alpha.png>
its really a mass-swarm-phaenomene ~^
there is `fan`s about -> `any` *lol ;:)
^^
mimicry .... or think at an `elvis imitator`
yes, its nothing other than stealing ideas from someone other
`FAN-Fiction` stuff here 😂 !
<@694560611601743893> pls let not deflect you from all that
but put your code somewhere to let read and use it for us all here pls ;:)
before flixel3d i am would give h3d a chance ;)
i would rewrite fnf into armory3d (thats perfect usecase for!)
ok, peote-view is more ready-4-haxelib at now .)= <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commits/master/>
(will clean the old ones out at now from the lib-repo [what is on my todo since >5years at now :] )
now only all samples have to test out manually 😂
(so now i am can clean the libcode a bit ;)
<@694560611601743893> and me did 🧹 today into 2d-peote-libset <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view-samples>
depends on what kind of game (e.g. into armory i can't use my 2d-lib on top) ... heaps have castle-DB and maybe other spice whats useful into production-usecase ... armory have better blender-pipeline and more of some 3d-spice into lightning and common 3d-engine-features

the direct haxe-bridge to SDL :)

anyway, for my spice here i am only need <:lime:567735656361492490>

yeah (anyway, its mabye only to focus on -> openFL)
or only into pre-prepared `env`ironments ?
do you also using lime pure sometimes ?^^

Anyway, Half, i will do my best ➕
( for -> `@`formula meta-constructors .)
<@694560611601743893> on my TODO.txt here only is -> integrate formula lib ;:)
(need 1-2 days to 🤿 into underwater cave ;)
i am totally forgot how it works
(And into all Approaches)
step by step
where we make more samples to test out
can we not open new folder into peote-samples for ?
i am need to see into sample-env ... really .. wanna FIX that
-> program.addTexture(texture, "aha",)
yeah.. thats the `texture-unit`
and a blender-asset how to make use of multiple-textures per shader!
step by step .)
i should do 5 new texture-samples for i am think
->its reallyFlexible!
hey, i am sure all is working there!
(into `Program` and shader-part)
(at end maybe some "map"-key only ;:)
i am thought to use "string" there is more flexible
"base" is only -> identifier
what a question -> into peote-view -> ALL where is an `@` is static->macro->generated `HARD`coded°!
you know me -> i am like to minimalize and optimize my base-stuff
2) GPU (where image is into final `Texture` - Slot)
1) CPU (where the image is into texture-data)
but i am have to keep 2 things into modular context
me not
<@694560611601743893> any changes will break all your code a last time there (before i am put into haxelib to never change API anymore for next 3 years .)
but into `TextureData` and Format-lib i am also not really sure at now .) [out of int or float-precision])
`Texture` will need all what OpenGL have (into limes max GL-ES-supportperTarget)
😂
`MONO`, `RGB` and `RGBA` ?
mhmmm... so :
(cos then you allways can `pack` two into a `4`-one ;:)
(never only 2)
me only into 1, 3 or 4 colorchannelDATA
sry -_- (thought you needs it)
(loaded by lime and the old `Loader`-wrapper by me ;:)
for PNG and GIF input-testdata
that one have to be -> finetuned!
but allways 4 color-channelSLOTS ;:)
hey, at now its only UInt or Float array
-> API-finished <- i mean
(at first we need to refactor a bit ;:)
hey, feel free to help me to make TexttureData and Texture -> finished
yep, they do not care about GPU ram there into ;:)
yes (but who needs that into openfl/flixel?)
it will ever be a 🌉 inside and the `name` is _final_
(also from other [`pure haxe`] libs outside of lime)
`TextureData` is only to `easy wrap IMAGE data` ;:)
NEVER
where i am not was known about data-size of images and all
mean also about our long discussion about how best is to `cache` and `stram` Data in and out last time into our direct chan
;)
-> modula 5
for me it gets born much of new ideas (a new simple lib is need .)[optimization]
\o/ YEAH
[i mean you are the MASTER of JAM ;:)]
<@231872730478280705> what do you think about <@694560611601743893>s ->
haxe representaion ....
into itch ? io ;:)
do you wanna join our conversation <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> ?
hey Logo *hugs ~ ~
aha
`minimalizm`
maybe image-file can be more `compressed` :)= into
into arch or any of them -> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions>
into _kisoking_
(the "debian way")
(but for myself i am prefer Debian)
yeah
exactly (i am also did put my stuff on)
is really cool
i mean .. kiosk-life litte usb-bootable systems
( -> the os and hardwarefreaks)
to try out
anyway.. some maybe really have fun
\o/
*lol
by a linux-bootserver (by serial IO and netboot)
or y make it only installable
yep
🙈
yeah, maybe the GAME-INDUSTRY only using (to train its AIs)
(no overhead)
i mean also by haxelimePeote!
-> thats all really possible !
yeah (with minimal linux-libc and fb-device kiosk-LIVE-system only ;:)
or a qemu-image :;)
you could put the windows binary into a docker -> SAFEHOUSE *LOL ;:)
sure, its on YOU
hey -> haxe is for ALL
😭
hope you ported for -> ALL targets :)
woah ... who knows whats inside then
kEy
oh, sorry
Is the other gamejammers also opening its source ?
(will wait how you name the git-repo ;)
maybe .. i am really can't remembr
🌅 🪗 🌳
-> `name`
-> `ingame!!!`
(the rest is -> DEFLECTION ;:)4me
(wanna see only your cool game)
sorry ... was only looking at your game (all outside of webbrowsertarget and itch-domainstuff i am filter out)
into jam-`map`
<@694560611601743893> its the `key` alias .)
all the time .)
-> IMPORTANT <-
is
-> NAME <-
absolute
(maybe i am to much text-affine)
-_-
i am really forgot it
ah ok
(before: "press ENTER" 😂 !!!)
`inline`!
also have to be
the `NAME` of the `GAME`
🙀 ohm ...so loooong ?
and how do you `named` your game?
anyway -> what is/was/will be -> result of itch-jam-challenge now ?
(without to get `out of sync`)
-> e.g. to let -> `stream` all `in` and `out` -> _DYNAMIC_ :;)
(then we also can test out the `cache`/priority behavior sometimes!
hey, then maybe only for image-galery :)
yeah
i am think the GenericStack.hx at end also only using Array there .)
sure .... sry (into web array is even fastest)
and Array or Vector?
oh, i am really thought some kind of _optimization_ there
ah, and why ? (do you using quad-tree ?)
(if it is faster as what you are implemented at now .)
and also you can use into game maybe
my image-galery
(is need also a graph-structure :)
(have all the ADTs and its name already on paper here ;:)
YEAH
at runtime!
no
<@694560611601743893> anyway (i am better should scribble it to you by mypaint ;)
it should be really fast to detect the collosions (to get an event like into `echo` also later ;)
but if you move one of the `Bag`s inside ...
And then like `insertSort()` (what is really slow into computing)
and superfast collosion-detection to all other images into the suitcase
I am wanna do that -> by hand <- ... e.g. move image around onto screen
(or often used also into texture-tile-packing algorithms where all tiles have not the same size)
so it is the classic
but without -> rotation <-
its also to arrange images (need a usecase to put all my ai-ones into galery;:)
(where i am often switch back into think about how to make best algorithm and datastructures for... uKnow;:)
i am think i have good idea at now (was also longtime-prj. for me)
into the physics what you are using
The game (and physic) also was inpirates me into something (needs new lib ;)
that ones saved my life
.. good also was the RESPAWN points !!! 💓 )
(while playing 10 min. or so ... forget how long
(was only die 5 times)
good _balance_ i mean into game-difficulty
but all was also not to hard to reach the next rooms
they was following me sometimes into vertically ;:)
(eh, and i am really not sure about the AI of NPC->KILLER :;) *LOL---
(there is some funny glitch by going into a wall sometimes~~)
and e.g. _jumping_ and _crouching_ also was feel awesome
also together with graphics -> best _athmospheric feeling_
that was like your style (cinematic!)
\o/
super snd-effects also ingame!
)
(the `gong` like `snd` i mean!=
(out of cool graphic and best sound-effects..that was cool into opener there!)
i am like your physic-implementation there also
(optimizing and polishing -> later or never :;)
this isnt also the most important into jamfuntime!
sure
have to be center-aligned!
cool ... also the start-text (all ingame i am mean!)
ahh... really sry... last time my eyes was only catching the gameFrame. ~_-
[last time here into chat i am was to tired to found out that is was the
  `ENTER` key to press to get _started_ :;)...sry]
(pls let me _mod_ the keyboard-config 😂 ;:)!
anyway, how was jam-session ending ? (prize 😍 🏆 ?)
i am also more like way of kanban instead waterfall into prj-management
its a waterfall-top->down management often to maximize profit

so i am trust him
half and me not live here to much far away
what should i say `?
hey, until i am not meet you or see your haxecode
(`cache` and all what make you -> track)
(even if you delete all on FF close?)
what makes it better into FF ?
(no stress into anything! [after put my .json conf in to let not hurt me!])
e.g. i am use to easy install vscodium into only 3 commands on debian here.

then you can easy install steam out of `stable` packages
you better should use `extrepo`

as you was to young ?
was your parents give you that game-toy
mhm... is that all -> `hardcoded` <- into your mind ?
or FAUNA and FLORA
or cool landscapes ?
(only sonic the urgin i mean .. isnt that not booring sometimes ?)
why you not paint faces and bodies ?
that one .)

kEy
do you better into graphics creation than into coding `? (or also into ``=`balance`)
do you used mypaint ?
(_intoOpenSpice_)
(or to work not alone!)
Good to share computercode
make your own one!
😭
your github site 😍 ?
(the last step before `fleischwurst` ;:)
and idea how to realize into <:flixel:230369617774641152> ?
(wanna improve my render-engine ... for better usage [more game-ideas only would deflect me then!])
no no .. not for me
(cos you good into p&p)
interesting .. do you have some scribbles ?
(also what can be : `realized in time`! ;:)
now i am 52
can be .... my english is not good enough for you

Ever thought about to also create own little "game" ~^ ? (what is not into existing games you play all the time ,.)
you only have to `use` it ~ ~
all `tools` are there already .)
<@729181341182066749> <:haxepunk:581178567602339840> what do you think ? (of sonicengine and haxe-spice;)
<:blobidea:964199768039510067> ♥️ 💕
( and what was the problem there into LDTK and great MAP ;:) ?
( <@694560611601743893> also pls tell me how is into `input2action` at now [into switching the "modes".]° )
( all small bugfixes, refactoring and optimizing and more polishing later than easypeasy )
( api 🌳 need to be `stable` )
🌅
_sooon_
cosIamReallyWannaPutItIntoHaxelib .)
and its also not the `units`, `slots` and `tiles` (that all is nearly perfect) ...
its to make all more near to OPENGL into Texture-Type (e.g. at now i am only was following the lime RGBA/RGB path... but need also only one or two colorchannels there to fill ... for final-optimization [and also better function-parameter-handling if to much paramaters at that one point there into api)
(can fix that all of where it is into your code on git then if you want)
<@694560611601743893> if i am soon try to improve the texture and data-handling ... (by universal new TextureType.hx for there into;:) ...
is it OK if API will change a little bit ? (to make it more flexible and 4/5-operable;:)?
(and how into code-organic grouping into modules ;)
wanna really see the holy haxe behind .)
i am only seen the cool screens and animation-captures at now.
mhm, but do you know Halfs proto at now ? (how we can test it <@694560611601743893> ?)
to _have complete that game_.
there have to _form_ a -> feeling
into the one who is playing the game
after game-action and all of story
something for the `player` to come down
definitively needs and end
yeah .. good game (if it tell story) ...
(->archivating later)

-_--- -__-- _____ ____-_-____ _-
<@694560611601743893> is it published on git into web at now ?
or also how to _dynamically let stream the new tiles in and out_ while _fast scrolling_
(like you are using `.cache=true` for a openfl-sprite)
(e.g. render all into one great sized 3000x2000 texture at first ... or render each of the tile everytime)
so we did not get sure whats the fastest way also to avoid lag
there all is 32x32 sized tiles for static background-compostion for one level
cos of <@694560611601743893>s last game-DEMO 🥷 (and how to let also run superfast on intels integrated gpu-chip)
it was cos of discussion by me and half (into directly to not let explode msg-amount here)
any `benchmarks` there ?
for me here really not true is , what the best aproach is to implement a 
supersonicfast `scrolling` of texture-atlas (or tilemap) with(by?) my 2d-rendertool
(how is into <:flixel:230369617774641152> ?)
<@694560611601743893> ... sometimes ->
anyway, tell me anothertime ^^~
and do you also not like procedural generated images ? (like fractals?)
cos i am need to go away from computer at now 🙂
or wanna send me later ? (tomorrow?)
*waiting
<@729181341182066749> can you please `paint` that for me by only some `strokes`
any by the way... what is a haxe ?
by your opinion ?
<@729181341182066749> what did i am wrong ?

Or is "human" proportions your first into lesson->weblink to me ?
-> deriVates -> not accepted!
by your own derawings please!
pls be my `coach` there into muscle-syncing .)
mhm, what of muscle it is ? (hope not what i am thinking of .)
how your mind goes throught the pen (like your words and all!)
show me how you paintflow is
gimme lesson

<@729181341182066749> this is how to play `instrument` only by `mind`



yes
is playing _its old rythm_ ;:~ .. . ~ ... ... ° ... .^^ ....'* .. * '. ''' .... . ... . .
Only the old `flute`-guitar ...
So `Flute` is still `broken` there -_-
the `web` audio `workletORnot` samplespace really not was much grown (was looking there yesterday)

... it could be the best jamming session ever .)
<@694560611601743893> but with the `flute` and all that existing `instruments` you know ...
(even if i am not put that "prompt" into)
i am love how `it` _mimicryes_ `surealism`

better this:
and by that `CAMERA` -> it looks -> `lost`

also here ...  only use the upper part (the peak into darkGREY is not balanced!)
is -> `ME`
any -> the human who `press the button` into that off

and next morning you only pick out the best 3
hey, that new stuff can generate thousands over night ...
<@694560611601743893> better like this .)
even if we not was talking about `british` kingdom tonight .)

any-> best i am found into at now it this:

<@694560611601743893> the prompts what was for your orign (backreversegenerated) is:
`a tall tower with a clock on top of it's side and a tower with a clock on top of it's side, Eishōsai Chōki, isometric view, a detailed matte painting, modular constructivism`

not sure at now (should adjust the knobs)

(ok, now -> crossplatform <- 🥷 )

.> you are using `LINUX` (^^)
the ml-oracle told me _*fasthandwish_

(not SD but the `trained XL` i am using there [without "refiner"])
look what  SD is think about your image+keywords .)
`really` ~_~





<- of `input` )img2img(
<@694560611601743893> the first one by your `design` ->
(`stable`)
(to keep my `lib`_s_table)
`4`myStuff here ~_-
this it the path2mountain:

yeah, print the whole level pls!
(to see how much your `prompt` is _influencing_ my one .)
wait .. i am render something other then
oh, you wanna draw it by hand ... sorry then
(wanna play with)
no no ... gimme your best screenshot at now
(or to see how it mix our `creation` into the one of `@everyone`;:)
So we have to `feed` that `stable-diffusion` image-trained-ai
with that what we have created already to get inspired i am think.
It have to help into your existing style!
how it looks into what is exist at now ... pls send me best of screenshots!)
(there i am need to enable that LORA for ... anyway, lets test out at first
(at now also is no pixel-art)
into your style!
to let try image->to->image
gimme a screen of your actual game (best into with = height)
hey, i am can render also more ...
anything is possible
make it low-pixel also ... but smooth-texture-pixel-interpolation and maybe you can use also the old blur-shader from the samples!
sure .. only great sized `Elements` there (no sprite is need .)
ah (puh ;:)
Do you cp/load it directly into LDTK ?
pls use this and not one of the first _tryes_°
(`mass`->generation;:)
inside of .)

i am like this one:
whaT is your `ukiyo woodblock mountain` keys is from ?

moment (that was only to warm up)
(crazy ... into lowres the upper clouds looks like codelines ,)
but you need to change the colors .. for your game there to fit into
(generation time -> 10s)
this looks good into ->  `parallaxe scrolling` i am think

even "tree" negative prompt helped to get the trees out .)

(anyway, copy/paste the mountains in .)
mhm... i am think you more need something like "panorama"-picture



near ready ... 1 min ...
uno momento ....
ok, the old `engine` runs again ... momento
moment (need to boot up all ,)
only if it not `lags` then if you put another Display or Progam inside

(for parallax scrolling)
do you need some kind of background-graphics ?
eh, do you think i am should render some ai-images at now ?
cooool
so a math-graph ?
o-o
what is `Node.hx` there ?
(this is our climbingtree.)
🌳
(you can make that "verlet"-peote-sample later!)
\o/ p e r f e c t (was seen that you are using also there!)
(the old DEMO 💓 ?)
(for physics?)
"verlet" ?
(graphic-creation-effort for sure)
Half, do you wanna know what my last idea was into write game with totally minimal effort ?
You already wrote a supercool ingame-editor i mean 🖤
+ `multiplayer`!
Also .. how about an `ingame` lvl editor (better now into codedesign as later also!)
or `technique`s
and also the `universal` hx-tools into ⛓️
sure (that have to been @keep ;:)
i am think `all is useful` (cos its your code and i am know you!)
some also could be useful later!
(of your game .)
(out of the real gamelogic)
will save time later!
yeah, all what you can make now -> outside lib
anyway, you can split them easy later
to fix it .)
then the Messiah have to come
and all is not `modular` anymore
or, the more the complexiness is growing into `logic`
the more it is need to refactor at the base tiles
the higher you build up
sure
eh, not tonight!
np ... your `inhouse` tools!
(good way!)
really `awesome`
eh
WOAH ... you put the CAMERA in \o/ *kisses
(thefeeling)
how is into peote-view ?
into flixel i mean ... you make child of childs and so on
to keep _overview_ i mean ?
your gamelogic (together with peote-renderer and all)
how do you `organize`
`really`_ \ \
\o/ *hugs DEEP
and how many folders and hx files are there at now (^_^) ?
Whats your largest amount of linenumbers into the .hx <:blobenjoy:964545740619808859>
(only seen the screens at now, not the code behind i mean)
or do you are using also all by LDTK - import ?
😂 like: `action2tileanimation`
?
into order of -> body-`animation`
what maps the tile-number of charactere-animation
how is your datastructures looking inside of your code ...
woah ... a sword and a couch .... COOL \o/
do you have new screen-capture ?
🫂
(lets do that later!)
no no ... better concentrate on 🥷 game
(to let it work also locally on each computer [and for all the targets])
or better: hxp
or lets write a shell script
(but only if no effort .. also to put new samples into space i mean!()
for the peote-samples repo
that could be useful maybe .. if all is really automatically
is that all up-to-date 😅 ?
<@694560611601743893> what you wrote sometimes ... really long years ago i mean ... to let generate all the samplecode by github-actions
(and then a link to the core-samples and the other demos and usecase-samples [ only to the code 😂 ])
also needs a better Readme with some `Synaptic` samples on start
yes, i am not wanna change the API later to much into major/minor ... better it should stay then for next 5 years (and texture-part really left into this .... the others i am think its finalpolished already and i am happy .. with .)
no no ... you are using it so much at now (i am can not do without your experience)
(i am only have this on my TODO [and the Docs for sure 😅 ])
<@694560611601743893> do you think peote-view lib is also ready for haxelib at now or should we better change the Texture-API (before others is using also then .)
how is going there 😍 ?
(the good into heaps is that it is more near to haxe and also using SDL[for maybe better integrate existing lime-stuff] ... 
 Armory3D have better blender-integration and other cool spice what heaps not have into 3d)
for 3d better is Armory or heaps!
("reflash" sounds like you made a `dd` of some stable state of .)
yeah \o/ (cool would be -> over the 🍎 <- 😂 !!!)

wow ... that looks so cool!!!
i am don'T build dvd-device inside anymore .. that ones allways die after a year ... even if using not so often
ah yeah 😂 ... then other pins there
yeah, that memtest also is good idea ... by defect ram it mostly only crash randomly while calculation or at some of temperature ...
i am think its the GPU there ;)
i had sometimes issues only cos of a plugged wire for floppy-disk (only the wire, no floppy at other end was give the issue)

who?
(`esc` to _stop game_ ... `´edit px of some of frame`  -> `esc` to _resume_)
-> also into `animationframes`
we better should combine all with multipaint, so everyone can `set the pixels`
-> _really FLASHING me_ ~ ~ _  ~ ~ ~
any of, the pixel-material-art asset what you are using still at now
pls let me put in some more `actions` into blender for that char .. so you can use and edit any simple `detail` 🪢 🎼

anyway... totally AWESOME <@694560611601743893> 😍
ah... no no .. i am see also now ... not my origin gamechar
reallyReally smooth -> pixelanimationart i mean!!!
or did you are used "quasifree" assets from otherwhere .) ?
oh, who creates that cool sneaking char-animation ?
do you reduced and then put the missing pixels in ?
totally cool ... do you get help by my "gamechar" there ;:) ?
here ;:)
`assets`
cos not enough of simple iconographie
sometimesIAmTHINK it only needs so much meme-links
<@151104106973495296> why we have no `icon` here for `planet pluto` `?

What do you are constructing on at moment into programming ?
<@694560611601743893> sorry, only some _fast & rough_ ideas by me at night .)
for :;) ~
SOFTWARE
the soundoutput .. so anyway .. i am only thinking into
disturb ...
(also the `click`-mechanic sound would
(even if not would get much sense cos raspi needs USB and no PX2 ;)
MODEL - M for .)
so i am thought ... how cool would be to use the WHOLE
there you also have to remember the `keys` i mean
.. where you press a key and then some 🚽 or other sound comes out
me get that ideas cos i am thought about that little toytools you know...
`sure` *hugs
to the -> passants 🪗
(to play it later into street 🌃 .)~
by pressing `key`-`combination`
and then you can go into `NATURE` to capture the `wav`
( 🦒 - `tape` [or 🦆 alternatively] to plug all together with a 🔋 )
old raspi + usbstick, old sound-BOX and MICRO, keyboard from junk...
so you need only little amount of money to build up ...
<@694560611601743893> or think like that ... you can also `capture` the soundwave ....
thats the most constructive into communication here .)
yes, i am also feel (haxe.io into general)
<@694560611601743893> goschn into klosett ?

https://youtu.be/H0mA592xow4?t=5689
`interesting`
but there was -> p r o b l em -> _upgoing_ 😆 ..cos of *lol)
had allways to  `sit` (instead of onlystanding)
ah, remember .. it was (southpark) cos the men into family
? .) ?
🚽
into
`stuck`
... e.g. do you know the part, where someone was getting
remembers me sometimes into southpark also ....
(or should someone call 🚑 cos 🚽 of .. all your memes
with your code `?
everythink ok ~^ ...
(half, and you can also use your gamepad into additional ;)
(or both keys only `single` ... so 2 keys -> 4 samples to play 🙂 )
... what do you think ?
( by key-combinations you can play 1000 samples .. i mean you can also have different soundsample if you e.g. press `a`+`s` vs `s` + `a` i mean
(boot your raspi with keyboard-plugged in ... have a simple sound-sample-player-tool)
for a pre-configured -> sound-MACHINE!
what you can load up on your raspi later
So the 🔧 at end is to configure a more simple setting
it should open you a text-input-field where you can select the sound-wave-sample from asset-folder to play!
and then the keyboard-key or combination at second ....
if you press the `ESC` key at first ...
but
it have to play a soundsample !
and if you press a key on keyboard (any should be predefined!)
you start the sample ....
anyway... think like this:
the only ui-spice we need is a simple autocomplete input-textfield
ok
By the way, have really good idea for a sample for samples at now <@694560611601743893>
(will change nothing more tonight there!)
WAY
ANY
😂 -> shit .. a `typo` *lol -> <https://github.com/maitag/input2action/releases/tag/0.7.1> ...
new `tag` 0.71 is also _stamped_ at github at now!
my whole code would end into one great hx file only ^^
Without good friends here i am sometimes think ...
Half, you really was gimme that `energy`
⚙️
(needs longer at now into github ... cos of that fucking 2 factor shit there since summer)
moment
into `mai` `tag` 😂
apropos ... i am really need to make a github -> `tag` at now
(or clone out only the old `git-timestamp` ;:)
yes, for older codebases it will be also easy to migrate
now its `final` into _codedesign_ *hugs thankful
yeah, sorry that the first version was to much overbloated (not sure what i am was did there stupid at that time)
(both ways is possible at now *hugs deep)
input2action-instance!
`keyboardActions` or `gamepadActions` for one
but the common way at now is to toggle only the
to have multiple `input2action` instances ...
I am think its possible also (like into TransferControl.hx you send me <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> )
and your up/down .. keys are controling the "options menu"
and press `esc` key (like into most games)
e.g. if you into game
-> `different modes` thing
yeah... what also i am should put into sample somewhere is that
♥️
but all into `AXIS`-handling .. i am think there should be another lib!
yeah, we should add for the joystick-buttons also sometimes!
or do like this workflow:
1) write the key-mapping config into pure haxe
2) three lines to activate it
3) later trace it out into json and put configuration into file
-> gamecode -> BETTER TO READ <-
e.g. into gamejam where is not much time to bloat up the code with much of input-handling-code
<@694560611601743893> really thank you ( now its really much better ... i am would not do this if i am wouldn' t get sure that you also will use that little tool sometimes)
If you would write it by hand, your code would have 4000 more lines for .)
its supereasy now to use for special cases .. e.g. you make a game where config is need where 2 players can share one gamecontroler or keyboard (or multiple key-combinations for some game-`actions`)
you can use it als ofrom within <:flixel:230369617774641152> without problems Alory
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/input2action/versions/>
its in
(5 min ... need some `concentration` at now ~~...)
😂
ok, i am submit it NOW
?
or should i am submit it as it is at now (all samples works smooth)
what each of function is doing here into DETAIL: <https://github.com/maitag/input2action/blob/main/src/input2action/Input2Action.hx#L29> i mean ?
(and "the samplecode says it at all" ;:)?
or should i shit on documentation for such trivial little api now there ?
bevore i can submit into our holy haxelib repo again (for halfwheat ;:)
For me its really the documentation at now ... you know ... *lol
so what not work into your code ?
eh, heaps can be much more performant into rendering and also more easy to organize your gamecode ! (more near to haxe .)
*lol
for me .)
hey, can someone now write the inline-doc for each of the functions there ?
me to
( or to make more easy to convert to heaps some day [on need;:] <@921126139664166952> )
Or to better integrate into your own keyboardevent-handlers!
Half, now you also don't need to register the event to limes window ...
and only can trigger the up/down functions directly (e.g. to manually send a key on need)
yeah, all more `clean` into my code ( 🍻 *lol ;:)
(for all public function inside here <https://github.com/maitag/input2action/blob/main/src/input2action/Input2Action.hx>)
so i am really should put the inline-documentation into front of each API-function now (before new haxelib-version ;:)
<@694560611601743893> before you make download-count of input2action lib to `2` *lol ...
look at what i am changed (reduced!) at now: <https://github.com/maitag/input2action/commit/07fa3d46ae2e160fdd67b64311d3f9da42d6828e> 🧹
ah, is it using the 9slice ones there ?
found out that i am need to change _input2action_ lib a little bit again to better let it integrate there again (using it for keyboardshortcuts there for text-input)
i was switching back to "peote-ui"-coding yesterday ... need to finish that old beast 😅
oh, but isnt that not only the haxeui-backend wrapper?
oh, not compatible anymore ?
you can use in flixel by this: <https://github.com/haxeui/hxWidgets>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets>
maybe you should look at wx widgets then
i a mtry to allways use the default systems mouse symbols
aahh.. ok ;)
what is haxes default "cursor" ?
Volapük ;) ?
Ö
😂
X
(where rate is a float from 0.0 to 1.0)
e.g. `sprite.y = rate.cubicIn().bounceOut().lerp(100, 300);`
into tweenXCore it would be:
ah, heaps also have lerp, thats good (i am not used heaps much at now but was looking often into src there) ...
i am will try out this one sometimes (into peote-samples): <http://tweenx.spheresofa.net/core/en.html>
cool
oh, for _tweening_ i am found good lib last time ...
heaps and h2d/h3d is good framework!
wish you luck and that everything will be finished and good
ahh.. for actual gamejam ... i understand at now 😅
oooch ~_*
looks good, pls put on git- hub/lab/... to let browse your haxecode 🙂
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/TextureDataInOut.hx#L76> the _image_ there is `TextureData` and can be lime-image, Uin8Array or Bytes but am think it needs more @from/@to there ~_~)

i am like to code into only `one` ENV :)
(also qemu or something .. i am really TRYED to get _Fammiliar_!)
for me "docker" is something what really never helps me really

<@369147264758710273> ... do you are the one with `DOCKER` encapsulation for testing also ?
oooh.. sorry... https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/596744553030090880/1199054682035867709
and what you did into "docker"-containers .. i am really not tryed out that "virtualization"-sphere around yet really [i am totally newbe into all of that]
(your "vision" lib should better get _interoperable_ with peote-view into _visualization_)
(my "vision" is math `&` 🌉)
my `formula`-test is not _passed_ at now (but was that lib for "matrix" into _origin_?)

(to not to WRITE to much AGAIN ;:)
(i mean to use our old TECH protoshit ;:)
maybe much better into sound as into graphics ... mhmm...
(like into multipaint ;:)
Can same be reached also into soundflow of _human_->interaction ?
`persistant` or `any` state at now
but the old `multipaint`-sample have no
_and_ have to get `edit` at _runtime_ (^_^)
(at best to get easy sync to graphics ,)
have to `play`
what need to `continiously`
its only a `wave`
... -> lets try it (together!)
i am on _minimalizationtrip_ again...
no no -> no no no
i have!
?
idea how to implement (by all what works stable)
"TransferControl".hx 😆 💯
*hugs <@694560611601743893> `deep`
thousand times faster _communication_ into _SameRoom_ ;:) ?
(cos of `internet-latency-time` and all that around of deflection?)
against a real soundmusik(creation)session with friends ?
Or do you mean into general, that all the computersound->generated stuff is nothing
or can i am only do the ui-part then ?
would you -> _invite_ ?
if i am would start a haxe-modtracker half, i mean only the `p r o t o` ,...,
mhmmm mmmmhmmm hm mhmm h mhm
🌅 🪗 🌊 🌳
(sometimes i am really need to change something into my baselibs!)
thats why i am love you 💋
(not sure into "replace" if you have to much of 🍝 ;:)
i can give you also reg exp to easy find
`migration time` < 5 minutes
yeah, gimme link to your code, and i am will _commit-it-out_ (you also only have to press the "merge" button afterwards)
<:blobpeek:964545740598804490>
y o u r -> _inner_ wall ;:)
_fuckshit_ -> you will break the wall and m o r e !
what do you will break ?
take your time (i am will test soon into peote-ui .. i am using it there)
(np)
-_-
_still_ 😍 ?
do you _testing_ ?
y e AH
`revising` is the _goal_
(your are really helped me to -> think my brain `in` again)
Halfwheat, for `input2action` -> _null_ effort.
be
may
wasm-influencing 🙈
haxe -> np
🌊 😢
last year
that i am not really GET it RUN
i am really ANGRY on ME ...
[throught wasm]
(cos of that wave-audio-lets 🙈 )
-> it not RUN into WWW-shit at now
the only FUCK there is then...
(without of "pre-captured-wave-sample"->ASSETS)
then i am only will use my GPU-fractal sound-protos to do more into multiplayer!
np
not without of you
together with the new kind of soundcreationtool (multiplayer!!!)
and than lets put multipaint (the old whiteboard)
so really .. lets make this year another sample for multisound
🪗
(me only using haxe)
oh sry.. i didn'T knowed
hey, np ... what language and env do you are using at now for ?
into old "tracker"-prj?
(to make .-> `great collage`)
(4sound-> all into samples)
(4graphics->all spitted into sprites)
(but for sound-editing)
(same like "multipaint")
simple multiplayer
my goal also is to make it
(i am really no "midi"-profi like you i mean into how to implement that ones)
do you mean for your usecase into plug in a digital piano input-device ?
\o/
did you implemented it already in ?
and also gamecontroler buttons ?
(into peote-ui)
yes, mouse+touch is another thing!
and all that "actions" there is only -> different soundsamples ?
but instead of `pointer`-device .. using -> `input2action` libkeys ?
can we do not same as old multipaint-sample (wb) but into modtracker ?
anyway ~_~ ... from now on the code is -> `ultraflexible` again !!!
better not let it mix together to much (out of the origin "configuration"-focus!)
analogue-joystick handling is different to whats inside at now
(only the true/false buttons and keys)
not sure cos the "axis"-handlers is not implemented yet into all
For me its not sure at what point i am should put into `haxelib` repo finally!
one day all that `states` will get _puzzle_ together also !
<@694560611601743893> where all you are was using that lib 😅 ? ( not wanna break your code you know! )
inside your game-`action`-functioncallbacks!
e.g. for a multiplayer-game you should have the fully player-Type-Instance
At now its only INT (but that have to be customizable by compiler-defines!)
that have to be the next step!
oh.. into README the "player" also have to be "param" at now!
-> <https://github.com/maitag/input2action#todo>
(before it gets out of mind again .)
nah, better lets test out all at now
ah ok ... sry.. thought cos of keyboard-limitiations (^_^)
(like shift, alt, control ...) ?
do you mean the common use of "mod" key ?
?
what .. where ... *panic attack
🚀
and today the implementation!
it really was .. 4 days thinking and conceptional work ...
(but if a bug there appears, i am know at now where to look at!)
i am also not 💯 sure at now if you using key to switch the configurations
Half, i am hope you can use it also now for modtracker!
any.. i am stil lhapy to found "elegant" solution for old 🍝 -code-prj ;:)
for me its new ... also into kind of aesthetic
https://media.surrealismtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12161229/2_AE79_new_low_res_77x65_85x72.jpeg
All "constellation" are possible at now, also 2 players can share one gamecontrollerpad!
Anyway -> perfect new codebase at now to grow up into more features!
ok, will test sometime with 2 on keyboard .. and with 4 controlers!
(what could be problematic on small keyboards *lol :;)
4 gamepads (more i am not have here to test) + 4 ones sharing the keyboard
😂  -> now we can do super easy 8 player splitscreen games !
And all only gets slower into optimizing if really 8 players sharing one keyboard or something
also the Input2Action.hx what holds the API is much more simple and understandable at now!
cos you can now easy switch between many input->modes (e.g. for many contexts)
should also work at now ... but i am think it is not need anymore ...
The "transferCode"-sample what was triggering all
code-cactusgarden
hey, sometimes it really helps to not look at some prj for some time to get out of blindness there into own
thanks to <@694560611601743893> !
<https://github.com/maitag/input2action>
`input2action` lib is rewritten into some days to handle all more easy ( into api and code and ALL there :;)
yeah, 2 years later ... aaannnnnd 😂 ...

really Ian, i am totally like that new AGE of AI .)~ (runs all locally also here!)
to press the button again (or capture some part of)

and then all my old fantasy-into-brain gets
its like a new tool for me .. to put some fractals inside .. then also some words ...

pure sample->starters there!
this is my wish for 24
or into armory!
pure flixel ones
so many old "modders" here (of any language) ...
-> why not some of them could also make some DEMO-s
for haxe and all the frameworks again!
i am wish that could also be
💯
or old `modtracker` machine
<@694560611601743893> do you remember into old `mega` Demo (into amiga-times) ?

SGWLFNF, can you put your `.savc` also into my lib here: https://lib.haxe.org/p/whatformat/versions/
ah, interesting (your own?)
what `fileformat` ?
Yeah
( 🪢 )
(good to know there is also `haxe`!)
(me also never played with)
godot ?
here
haxecoders
poor
we are also only
and tell us here 💓
Wami, better think about
oh, what do you are using instead ? SGWLfnf
ah, like: <https://api.haxe.org/haxe/crypto/Base64.html> ?
what do you mean by: "container" ?
(and not all software there is for long!)
into `3d` you are forced to use more `tools`
<@1048007979045232680> this is what i am like into doing 2d -> simple math there only ;)
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Euler2a.gif/220px-Euler2a.gif
(woah, how cool would that implementation into armory3d🚀)
the last there into code (and with that `chunks`) i am really like i mean.
never _heared_ about ?
at least you need to `rotate` the camera ^~ .:. . .. .:.  .. : . ... : ..:. ..
vec3 or vec4 ?
only4`rotation`iMean
for your game
what coordinate system do you are using into go-dot ... Euler or Quarternation ?
awesome!!! !! !! !!!!!!!

my motivation at start of year also was more like
hey, that will really help you !
(or _little_ motivation what halfwheat was gimme tonight into our old together-codespice)
how much using or give you feedback into code there ?
(my "summerOfCode" *lol ;:)
(since last summer!)
mhm, i am only have experience into haxearmory3D
so all 3d .) ?
Half, we also have to make more here (the last time we "stopped" ...) <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/walkcycle-with-variations>
hard to imaginize (have a screen or code-link=?)
where ?
(also all your `comments` 💓 !!!)
sure, you are allways welcome into peote-land !!! (i am will `merge` any code of you -> directly `IN`)
you need no reason, but tech ?
and why a `clone` ? (out of that really is need since m$ make now totallyFUCKwith good old minecraft)
whats the special haxe part into your block-engine there ?
*hugs Wami Umngane
Wami, whats your Plan into HAxe for 24,,, ?
(only little ones .. but mega->jumps ;)
e.g. by laying into meadow
me often
aah
something to eat ?
Umngane: a r o u n d ?
did they are jumping also ?
me need ☀️
wintertime
yes, more -> realtime (anyway.. we could use GPU also to MIX many together!)
but not -> into future (if frequency changes continiously)
i mean i am can interpolate inbetween time ...
what `future` input is!
it also can only be "stepped" cos you are not know
(like that old oscillo)
you mean -> `modulation`
moment (will find at first where the interpolation was)
here ? -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/wavechunks/src/SinWave.hx#L42> ?
mhmmm
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth>
moment
oh.. ups. wrong link
one of them
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/pixelimage/_starter/src/Main.hx>
openAl -> np!
only -> wasm <- was sucks!
yep ( i am was show to you at that time ! )
smooth it is already ( thx to <@272509832421179392> )
ah..remember at now ... the shitty web-audio stuff  (fuck .. than all can be only seen on native-targets)
(into old first-GPU-test .. i am really wanna know how it sounds by MANY ;:)!!!
you have to help me than (to keep the main-wave slow!)
yeah.. i am really wanna DO (time comes;)
(with neighbours)
but not if all is into cell-sync or some of spice
1000 💧 maybe
2d-animation -> soundsynth
you have to think more like a -> synthesizer
how the graphicFlows
anyway... i am need to use GPU then to `generate` and `mix` them at same time
shiiiit
(and let them _walk_)
(into how iam spawn them on 2d-area)
for graphics
cos only then i am can be sure that is into sync what i am did
for peote-audio into lib i am need a sound->bunnymark like sample!
128 ?
but how many at same time is maximum ?
https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/502857487888809985/1194806031453257768
e.g. we can let `walk` the graphic-assets at now ...
but how to let each of them being a `sound` source?
<@694560611601743893> how do you think to `sync` with _snd_ jam into ?
All can be supersimple setting up as a web-service also by this!
( -> fastest and easy way ! )
that the python-ml-freaks also mostly only like to use that web-ui stuff 😂
Half, what i am also find crazy at now since experimenting with is ...
Since playing with `SD` i am really think not long and all doing -> mass-production <- with (and still at now!)
outside of procedural by formula ?
Anyway, isn't that graphic or sound creation also something ...
but i am really missed the poor pure haxe coding a bit
wanna use all what i am learned there also at now for the peote-libs and graphicsflow
*hugs deep (sry.. i am was to long into haxearmoryland ~_~)
you send me today (`TransferControl.hx` <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>) -> opened my eyes!
your sample spice for our old `input2action` lime-lib ( to wrap tricky around the missing `mode`-feature 😅 )
into _creation`process`_
the graphics-pipeline need to be -> `stable`!
2d-graphics (with lesser effort ;:)
this year i am also wanna concentrate more again to make better

hey, most of my haxelibs also only i am using by myself (or for others who like to read good haxe c o d e ;:)
cool .. you have to make it a haxelib !
what is with your `sho..`s
pls tell me
ivan, you old pixelmonk ~ ~
(what is you in a haxe?)
(no macrospice -> no fun)
all had to do by -> `macro`
(and for image-sequences there is need another player into the game:
 -> image-magick <- ... not sure on all OS into World that one is available ;:)
i am even not sure that my old macro to load some text is also working for images
for sure .. .only if you think that you wanna see it there (into haxe-demospace i mean)
And you only have to give us the web-links to your latest animation-data!
into new demo-folder of halfs good stuff \o/ ?
out of that at first i am really wanna make a simple main.hx at now
do you wanna know what my `dream` is into ?
yeah, make it -> interactive
1/4 only for your real ownwork
no no
1/2 -> concentraion ?
you can also `chat` all the time
afterwards
no hard work -> no fun
you should animate that one!
then its really good to see after all that -> `ml-generative`
hey, if you painted it ..
lovely

if i am write my demo .. i will make all -> camelcase
also into "namespace" ?
(no openfl or flixel lib on top is need .. only peote-view)
test it out on your new lime-installation
take your time
what do you think about ?
look into the code we prodused here last days:

i am also like to see more `nonstrict` tmp variable definitions

i am would help you.
`own code`
if it would be your
(luajit->externs on 🍎🍏🍎🍎🍏🍎🍎🍎🍏  )
no panic (only warnings!)
and not do a openfl or lime excursion at first
if why most people only using flixel at first
what i am reall wonder sometimes
<:lime:567735656361492490>
Ivan, lime is really the best (i am only USING;:)*hugs
to your friends (on same haxe-target)
you can easy deliver only one executable binary file
and if you put your asset-graphics and sound also inside
by `-static` option, you can also build all your haxelime stuff into only one `binary` (no dynamic linked libs files are need anymore into additional)
<https://github.com/openfl/lime#building-from-source>

( -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/AssetMacro.hx>)
(i did simmiliar already for text-files)
on the first time it is compilng
by the way .. we could also load all needed assets by a macro
(same like into halfs code!)
(i am will `merge` it without think about then!)
or beter -> if you really wan't -> git commit it inside by yourself
(we put the link to your `host` then into a haxe-comment)
(creative comm...)
and where is -> license .. like CC
never tell us ;:)
puh, i am really thought you will
https://www.pixilart.com/sig7
ah.. so this is yours siggy ?
(or older work ?)
painted into 5 min ?
wow.. is this you ?
sure, but is it then own by you or by pixiart ?
on your domain there i mean
https://art.pixilart.com
can you let others also let simple `edit` it on that webservice you are using ?
(only -> no more is need .. all my libs also backward-compatible)
(e.g. on every new linux machin .. the first i am do all the time also is:
`apt install haxe`)
then its good tool
\o/
can you not simple do an `apt install` ?

pls give us URL
whats you profile there?
(for me!)
(no more other complicate WM)
e.g. .. also into linux i am only will using `i3`
(the "simple" tools is NEED!)
\o/ .. yeah, try something new out by time 💓

(my walkcycle have also some `curves` insight)
And then -> lets try to sync the walk to some sound!
have to get into sync to position-change (x only at first;:)
the speed of tile-animation
lets continue -> walkcycle ...
sometimes
🥲
half, we also have to finish the modplayer
i am for myself also only using Blender
eh, for video and audio composing ..
Apropos.. stable diffusion tech also can generate sound at now!
but i mean also do `edit` the `soundwave`
hey, on linux i am only using `cmus` at now
\o/
jooo (or directly into audicity ;:)
or the cool old `oggplayer`
for audio into past i am liked mpg123 or 321
(vlc also is ok!)
i am like `mplayer` for anything
(and at first into list there is its own `playershit`!)
hey, win10 also forcing me (penetrating!) to allways set up
what the "default app" should be for a fileformat
(selfpainted also ;-)=
aahhh (thx)
pfp?
eh Rudy, new Avatar-Image here (^_^) ?
ora is cool format!
you can save as ora .. and load into krita i am sure (also into gimp i am think)
oohh.. mypaint is the BEST ;)
(-> never ever shitty adobeEOL-stuff again!!!!!!)
yeah, gimp and krita i am also using ONLY since much of years at now
(to much years to use PS at job-time into the past)
i am really not warm enough into gimp
(if not using blender all the time i mean)
yeah .. more is no need (blender is really to complex for pure 2d)
(with the keyboard-shorteners)
(again ;;)
(i am fast as into 2.78 ;)
(but blender new UI is ok for me at now)
yeah, for me its also hard
<@694560611601743893> what do you using _normaly_ ? (out of into blender->assetpipeline like at now into 😂 )
into what software do you created it ?
5?
how many frames !SIG7Ivan/Alory ?
but this would be ok i am think (i am no advocate) https://art.pixilart.com/sr27afd7d5346aws3.gif
(i mean with sonic-char of that company!)
you know what i mean ( you even can not use an 🍎 nowadays anymore without getting into trouble with an army of lawyers from that concern ... and with nintendo is the same!)
with SEGA
where maybe sometimes i am will get into trouble
to use assets into peote-samples repo,
Also you have to take care .. i am not sure at now
and if it crash, it tell you why
really (neko never crashed here since 10 years)
<:lime:567735656361492490>
but commit it only if youself was creating it (pixel by pixel)
so what TOOL do you was using for ?
ah... sorry !SIG7Ivan/Alory (what is a haxe) .. thought you was told me
oh, who told me last time ? (thought it was you)
and you can put in your aesprite-anims!)
(only haxelime + haxelib git peote-view ...
you can test also our simple samples if you wanna !
is haxelib also working ?
what.. flx needa kEy ?
\o/
.)
you can give us also ssh-access to your computer, so we will install it for you!
yeah, step by step

for `haxelib run lime`
lime can be also only an `alias`
then try this to find where your haxe or lime is (maybe in /usr/bin directly?)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)>
do you have the `find` command on your apple-bsd ?
(we have to create another "main" for "starter"  .. so your main into mainHalfwheat.hx or something ... wanna create also mainSemmi.hx for another demo tonight 🙂)
is the next goal !
the formula what makes the tile-anim in depend to the moving-speed
the _latest_ diff-tarball ;:)
yeah ... half, do you checked out by git ?
any, on win10 here -> also a mess sometimes
(and mac using [free or open?] -> BSD <- under the hood .. so also unixlike)
and set the paths to it manually
haxe is really only binaries .. you can also download the zip ball
the last mac i am really used was an 68k
*lol
*jokingly
~^
mhm, can you not install linux there ?
do you on macintosh ?
ive read here that there is trouble
is your haxe-installation working again ?
(in depend of how large the way is from startX to endX)
define the "tile"-anim speed!
yeah .. so now this formula also need to
eh, put your urchin-walk also inside!
(cos only the x-position is need to "anim" -> more optimization at now ;)
also some other things gets _smaller_ at now into code-mess:<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/bd7d99eb2d770992a3df19378a670506167f17c9#diff-8ccbe3b01e4d23c912eb4d565437a93213dc15d2cac40be44956e486193586ccL102>
🍻
\o/
this is the _trick_ 🙂 -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/walkcycle-with-variations/src/AnimTileSprite32x32.hx#L16>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master/>
ok, its in
(only last check thats still the same output ;:)
yep.. moment, will upload
<@694560611601743893> also optimized your demo from monday-night at now .. so this is now obsolete:
and how to do all by my blender-tool ;:)
i am only interested into haxelime (or also armory3d a little bit;)
never tryed or looked into godot, no idea
yeah
mhm. at the end the pixel-way is also only
one kind of `abstraction` to give the beholders brain
some more freedom into interpretation
this is the better way for pixelart into animation (and looks cool;:)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsOKwUwL1bE
so better maybe like this:
anyway.. also creates some cool little robots ;:)
i think its not the time at now .. 
into 3-5 years maybe you only draw your 32x32 pixel char
from front and side .. and the ml-tools will make it into
`any` pose fully automatically (but not at now ;:)
also this one: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffl8b_GfJ-M> btu there i am think the "walk"-cycle looks totally bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ismWniiT8ew
Found also only 2 tutorials about .. e.g like this one:
so next time i am will try to let only generate the textures for the 3d-mesh
The tricky part is that the walk-`animation` looks same as good as into my hand-modeled blender one!
(so i can pick up the 5 best of)
and SD ml need to generate 100 variations of !
this is my goal: http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/anim-walkcycle/
i am to lazy also at now to make all of that control-poses (extra-addon)
into a tilemap also ... need to find some better way ....
its this lora-model here: <https://civitai.com/models/165876?modelVersionId=186677> .. special trained by someone for game-assets into pixelstyle
(i put the mouse-hand there because i am not wanna get `censored` here again 😅 ;:)
anyway (interesting how it try to generate "pixel-art")
not what i am wanna to get out ...

no, its all by machine-learning (SD)
(but also not really perfect .. look at the eyes into that one ^^)
any.. the pixelart stills i am get out at now looks cute 😂 :
Will try next time to generate some UV-map instead to use inside of blender then to make more random variation of my char-walkcycle-blueprint
wonder why there is thousands of trained-lora-models for all kind of anime-still pictures into manga, fantasy, whatever-style ...
but only ONE what TRY to help into create -> walkcycle for gameassets
(but no realy walkcycle -_- yet)
but get out some funny images like:
mhm, i am also give up into stable-diffusion and my walkcycle at now ...
yep, nowadays also hard (e.g. also to communicate between different frames)
(also will be all into a new browser-tab since much of years nowadays)
to open multiple windows by haxelime also makes no sense into html5
yeah, "web" is only -> inside web-browser-window
you can ask the developers!
cos of WASM there ? (into haxe it only needs some different modus operandi into UI sometimes)
mhm, but for the walkcycle i did something wrong (it doesn'T show up the "pose"-control-armature)

and also this one ^^
mhm, not really works with the poses but get a blue ninja out 😂
but for my walkcycle-experiment i am will try out with this one: https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/847ea402-0a39-46f4-82a5-fa6c66941cb2/original=true/123.jpeg
There is also a good trained lora one by some guy for pixelart-gamescenes: <https://civitai.com/models/214538/sdxl2d-game-scene-generator-or-dataset>
yeah *lol ( anyone can generate thousands of that fnf-char now into some hours)
https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/e6221b49-e82f-4f62-9fec-14824ef3e203/original=true/Boyfriend_Sprite_Version_SDXL_20231126235716_e000016_01.jpeg
oh, while searching for "lora"s to pimp up my walkcycle by Stable Diffusion ... look what i am found there 😂 : <https://civitai.com/models/213311/boyfriend-sprite-version-sdxl>
oh, I haven't seen it yet, must take a look
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master/>
<@694560611601743893> ok, its in at now. (sry that was need so long to find back my auth there ;:)
any, wanna `know` (^_^)

mhm, for animated 2d i am not found good way,
how new AI can help me into ;)

mhm, i am thoughts i installed that ... maybe _glitcht_ with new "XL"-1024x1024
shit, i am really need to train my own lora:




mhm, looks hearoglyphic ;:)



_thereIntoSpice_
before training my own LORA
i am really need to learn how that "control"-net extension works there
(the 10th try)

will play with my "ml"-tool here at now (alone)
(not sure by myself)
have a good sleep ( d d d )
oh half, you was so much good friend to me again tonight *hugs deep
color-variation
by
(even into "mass")
-> so alone
cos
they also wanna know eachother
sure
arena
screen
of
into middle
how they all kill eachother
(if you wanna)
i am can also animation

hey, half.. but we only let them running
totally
we should make all -> iso3d (very easy)
(they have `colors` also there!)
we really should using that new tweening-lib
(and halfs color scheme ?)
late night ?
or do you mean into what was the speech-context here at
also ?
do you graphic-affine ?
our names ?
we ?
for me here .. same -> new IDE (not will know how much years i am need to "re" learn all again into)
(into endless _repeat_ of _mousemoves_)
(you getting `stucky`)
(at moment i am know)
(i am tell you all the blender shortkeys ;:)
you are very welcome into that
my little 3d quad-model is really -> meta-sprite ;:)
(sry..`really`-_-=)
`pass`->_phrases_
..only -> phrases...)
(but have also that "meta" key here ...
no, only github
(not github .. the "pass" metakey here .. 🙈 -> i  am stupid! )
thx
(tomorroW with clean head i am will search key here or reinstalling ALL!)
will keep that into mind
you have to let the user of your tools later to get the choice (a slider to scale all down)
(our little peote-samples:;)
(the amount of upscaling)
yeah, we do not have to think about "limits" there into anymore .)

mhm, can i am even read my `pass` password as
f
t
w
(so no access gets lost.. any .. i am can also at any time make own git-web on need)
at moment i am was forced to change to that
np.. somewhere i am have noticed that long "key"
have to be some layers into backwards
i am can't found also back
and on all here papers laying around on my table
(to make that pass otp github for)
no no (its only problem that i am not remember the password)
on my table
it have to be here somewhere into geologic-levels of
fuck .. i a m not find back that key (since github->2-pass)
(really cant found .. what the hell .. m o m e n t)
where is the pass for my pass key *LOL
(*lol -> moment()
mhm.. where the hell is my meta-*key
ohoh.. have to search into my history *

*deep kiss
<@231872730478280705> do you feel still sad into my way how to using that new "machines" .)?
of what i am put -> `in`
into _interpretion_
its interesting to see how the ai-brain is working
like it
anyway, i am

(out of that never matching the `exact` animation-originale)
What do you `all here` think of my second try into ai-decoration?
-> prehistorikLIKE *lOL ;:)
a _human traffic light symbol_ like ;:)
it make all my work into


half, yep .. not its more looking congruent:
(good that we have our magick-tool there at now)
i am should make all -> 1024x1024 for `input` there at first ...
interesting ;:)

second try ->
😆
`null`
-< first match >-


ups ....
lets see
the original handmade one ;)
have not much hope that it will be a _smooth_ animation like

_<@415825875146375168>opening it's ~stableDiff `tool`_
if every char here is `individual` then (by own texture-atlas by SD .. lets try that *hugs <@694560611601743893> deeeepRealDreaming***)
(i need help to "sort out" maybe here *lol ;:)
i mean how crazy it will look .. if then there is ai-generated walkcycles
ment
anyway --- > h a v e <- to >TRY< now (keep your codingflow half .-. will _commit_ it later -> INSIDE 🧡. ... will open that "variation"-maker at now to see how much it get outside of "walk"-animSpice ..° .^^.... °m, o
(better for "stable diffusion" .)
originally wan'T to make all 1024x1024 texture-atlas
...oh.. shit, did a little mistake ...
\o/
a we some
halfwheat, anyway, i am happy that i am get motivated tonight (by you) to put that into repo .. the new starterkit ;:)
that _gimme hope_
~~
but where are all the little demos into scene ?
The last time i am looked into "shader"-tools, there was also much of spice...
maybe only no one using Blender-tool 😂 ?
🌌
yeah, i am think also T H E R E \o/
me to (i am never touched <:flixel:230369617774641152> at now [only 🫂 <:openfl:567735656017821708> ] a little into kind of demo-scenario yet)
🙂 is it more "beginner-friendly" i mean (^_^) ?=
is the Tilemaps there also the best of _Choice_ ?
Half, what do you think would be need to do same demo inside of Flixel ?
(e.g. since summer i am not touched .. and you see at now how SLOW i am get into to find that back and into ALL ~_)
superfast back again
but lets do it really simple into readme and only that we can find it
jo.. this is need -> at FIRST
`var OPTIONS = { blend:true };`
😢
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/5e419f8af8a6a176990fd80118cb9217eb0ce5f6/anim/walkcycle/src/AnimTileSprite.hx#L22>
e.g. tonight i am had to search for this line here:
-> what all that `@metas` means
(into details)
for some of _parameterization_ there!
-> better would be a little more documentation
i am also have to look into sample code all the time
e.g. ... into peote-view using ..
and you to!
hey, i am have to write also more README before
(but you still tonight into simple sample demoSPACE ;:)
you will be my messias then
if you forget about
into change that code all the time then
i am maybe only not wanna extra-effort
i've never looked at the code into detail
why you not commit this to peote-view then ?
but not the code into detail
i am remember
also ?
hxp
oh.. sorry .. i didn'T knowed
(what if we all have to switch to another git-"host"-newIMPOrTANThing into some years i mean?)
but why not some simple shell scripts `?
the "actions" yeah
(and to have some "links" to send)
for me that all is mostly -> backup-space ;:)
hey, i am also can make also sucha "prj"-think by github (and that special"actions") but i am think at now its to much effort for only us both ;:)
yeah
any, its up to you ,
(there i am see much potential into variations)
how do you will `name` it ? (better really also new folder for!!! )
Half, you really have -> the best `ideas` ~~
by  `@formula` (really tricky then .)
that can be do also all on shader-lvl
(relative to x-moving-speed)
yep (you need to change that 1.4 value!)
💯 💓
to let them walk from opposite side into middle!
no no ... its super cool idea
half, what the hell you are DOING nice fucking s t u f f _tonight_ \o/ *hugs veryVeryVERRY D E E P l y
(the x-pos anim needs slower! [or alternatively the time for walkcylcle)
<:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
`exactly THIS`
eh... ->
wooo AHHH \o/\o/\o/
(whats _possible_ into _spice_ ^^)
(like into old "demo\o/"-times of _simple doing it_ ;:)
https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/502857487888809985/1194076307881988117
(so we could do little jam-challenge ;:)
I am also would be very interested into how same works into OpenFL or Flixel
with your tool ?
here: https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/162664383082790912/1194020853264945222 ?
like <@215582414544699393>❤️ `?
do you created frame by frame and pixel by pixel by hand ?
urchin?
How long it did for you and with the little
Not much creating own walkcycle also into computergraphics.
i am will remember you!
only of simplesamples and demos also
<@694560611601743893> i am think at now its a _loose_ collection
(np!)
<@729181341182066749> make an `alory` one 🌻 !

at now we have this:
<@694560611601743893> if you wanna you can also make a new folder (^^)

(replace all into asset-folder by your ones .. and then only adjust the frame-amount into main.hx haxe-code and the default size also maybe)
and then rename into : "walkcycleAlory" maybe ~_^?
!SIG7Ivan/Alory (what is a haxe) you should better copy that folder only as it is at NOW ;:)
this is the starter-test: <http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/anim-walkcycle/>
feel `absolutely free` to git commit also please 💓 !
Main -> .... -> .... (many ones into one folder!)
yeah, like this here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/5e419f8af8a6a176990fd80118cb9217eb0ce5f6/anim/walkcycle/project.xml#L13>
maybe ;:)
half, the file name "AnimTileSprite.hx" have to be "AnimTilePosColorSprite.hx" then or something
yeaahsch
e.g. my "element" what i am was need at now only animating `tile`-number
(for easy switching what need to build)
and then a new comment into project.hx
and the "element"-ones -> what is "animated"
yeah, name it walkings.hx or something ...
same one
pls put your assets also inside (half and me will make it -> DEMO!)
💯
you are peote-view -> PROFI <- at now!
only YOU 💓
🌅 🌳 🪗
Half, do you still trying 😍 ?
into one direction (but next line of them have to walk into other one .. you can make simple mirror by set @sizeX to -32 i am think)
walking all one by one into a snake-like queue
so 25 ones into x-direction
yeah, butter step by step (before dynamic-resolution-change at runtime)
(if you fully zoom out .. every one only should be 5x5 ;:)
or mousewheel to zoom in out
make it 16x16 per tile!
(that value will be directly hardcoded inside the glsl-shader then!)
gl-buffer will be smaller by using `@const` meta-tag
Bulby, apropos, that will be little bit -> `particle`-like then (but in haxelimepeote!)
here into another simple sample byside is how to `anim` pos and col:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/simple/src/AnimColPosSprite.hx>
```-> -> -> -> -> ->
<- <- <- <- <- <-
-> -> -> -> -> ->
<- <- <- <- <- <-
-> -> -> -> -> ->
<- <- <- <- <- <-
-> -> -> -> -> ->
<- <- <- <- <- <-
```
let them _march_:
(but they should also move x position [y not need to animate!])
better into lines
its mostly only to pimp up the Element-definitions
to write sucha DEMO ;:)
with my old haxe-develop ide i am would at now only need 5 minutes
😆
and then to fill the whole screen with walking chars (all into different colors ;:)
and into next line the same but into other direction
so 20 at same time into one direction (into a char-queue) ...
to let walk more then 2000 on screen ( maybe into 32 x 32 ones )
Half, how many TIME you would only need at now (by building up on that simple samplecode)
frames :)
24
for
seconds
1.4
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/anim-walkcycle/
For my stuff here i am also wanna generate also "normal"-maps at now (and the "depth" ;:) -> need it for my old work inside of peote-view and shaderspice
with a `hard` brush and some _settings_
i am will show you sometimes ... how to use blender to paint into really low-res texture (and to see how it looks at same time into animation ;:)
(was more easy to use blender later to _visualize_ my old fractal-formulas!)
http://www.povray.org/
no no ,.... the only i am tryed also was -> POV
(20 times faster than animating a 3d-model)
cos i am can do it really simple there (and using same tools as into 3d)
mhm.. then i am not would using for my here!
i would use for me here only blender .. also for pixel-art and anim-of
(also files from 10 years ago i mean i am can load into the latest version!)
(into blender [my only TOOL] i am never get problems into loading older files)
oooh.. paid .. then it have to be gooood 😂
for the face-expressions
that one here into asset-pipeline: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/bulby>
Bulby, what software do you was need to create your Bulby head ?
\o/
now all is ready to create super easy game-assets for my old haxelime peote-engine
to make animation-WALKCYCLE -> more months
to model my char-MODEL really minimalized .> was needs months to get it really
(my fractal-renderings needs hours -> AI-image-generation only 10 seconds 😂 ;:)
i am like to use my computer here to simmulate that old math-spice
sure
no particle-stuff -> more like "voxel"-rendering by cycles (real-lighned)
volume-rendering-stuff (by my own fractal-formulas!)
aahh.. no no -> THAT ones is my
(at muchest minimalized as i am was able to create!)
this is only my riggifyed 3d-model of a walking char
maybe .. but never my old particle-stuff .)
where .. do you tested out also ?
(i can send you other things i made with particle-integrated-engine.-..)
hey , there is no particle-stuff i am did there
particles ? (in java 😱 ?)
(but needs material-finetuning.. all is only using ambient-occlusion and nothing more into lightning there)
or you can using evee - renderer (that still using opengl)
(its faster then!)
on your computer!
there should also be the integrated intel on

set up your GPU
how long for all 24 images ?
it works \o/
mhm.. anyway ;:)
(maybe your linux-WM have this keyboard-combo for another action ? .. i am using only `i3` here)
crazy
so if you wanna edit all easy you should activate it ( `Edit`>`Preferences`->addons)
Oh.. and its using the integrated `riggify`-addon of Blender ...
wonder why ctrl F12 not work on your computer (on linux here its the same)
into main-menu on top -> `Render`

oh, then click here:
(needs to test out!)
i am think it was intoxo, 01010111 or msg who told me sometimes .. that also lesser is looking ok into frames for a WALK ;:)
(or same as old: 24, new:12)
old:100, new:50
(i mean if there is 12 instead of 24 frames for whole walk)
need to fit a little bit the image-magick script

you can do it here into blender:
i am think it will still need 1.4 seconds for its walk-animation
not sure what is if you set up framerate of lime to half
*LOL (no no ... peote-view is more easy! ;:)
[you can do also make all into 12 instead of 24 frames per walkcycle very easy into blender by only change 2 values there°!°]
pls try out also my image-magick script ;:)
(while F12 is render the image at frame ... -> `ctrl f12` renders the full animation into `./render/` folder as image-sequence)
do you opened also the blender file ?
🙂 tHx
i am don'T wannt to let it walk to fast
thank you ( -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master/anim/walkcycle> )
yep, 24 frames into 1.4s
was trying around before upload .. moment, will fix that!
to slow down also to 1.4 (all into 1.4 seconds)
ahh.. sorry.. that number inside of comment was forgotten
😅 i am only would touch or even think about to use -> JAVA <- only if someone gimme much (really much) of money (and 1/2 before job starts!)
🙏 wtFunk ;:)
oh, another "java"->ui-thing ?
ah, still into wayland ? (our ,,, out of X-land :;)
(not sure my english is buerocratic-correct there .. cos wan't also for sure that every committer can use own for assets, like you did into sample here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/bulby/assets>)
oh, bulby, cool that you are here ... i am added also now the default creative-commons-"license" for our graphics-art: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/LICENSE_FOR_NONCODE.txt>
<@694560611601743893> ok, its `IN` at now ..puh 😂 ... *hugs -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master/>
what do you mean ?

ok, will delete all unused comments and then -> upload ;:)~

lets try out also auto-anim .. moment
yeah.. now it works ...
momemt ...
was long time not using (slots is for "units")
aaahh... see it now also (sooorrry ;:)
its like this at now:
```haxe
class AnimTileSprite implements Element
{
    // position
    @posX public var x:Int=0;
    @posY public var y:Int=0;
    
    // size
    @sizeX @const var width:Int=128;
    @sizeY @const var height:Int=128;

    // animated by shader:
    
    // texture slot
    @texSlot //@anim("Tile")
    public var tile:Int = 0;
    
    
    public function new() {}
}
```
(should only display one tile of the 8x3 tilemap)
mhm, not really working at now 😅 ....
any .. into old haxedevelop ide i am was 10 times faster !
yeah (even notepad++ using ctrlQ)
mhm, not working (normally i am used ctrl Q)
oh, another shortcut i am missing .. how to `comment/uncomment` ?
emergy solution ;:)
the problem is .. after ctrl+c you have to deselect all and put cursor below (have also copy/past on mouse ,, but wanna avoid that extra clicking)
mhm.. have also no windows-key on my old modelM-keyboard here
shitty.. that only works for ONE LINE
mhm....shift alt up/down ... moment
but what is equivalent to ctrl-D ?
(woah.. that works \o/)
(delete was same but -> ctrl X)
oh.. sorry... not DELETE .. i mean -> DUPLICATE
mhm, into HD was only ctrlD .. also the line where the cursor is in
remembers me into head of a bull
mhm, what is keyboard-short for delete line or selected lines (ctrl D is not working anymore) ?
not sure also to deleta all .hxproj files into git-repo at now
for my workflow here into that (will need its time!)
its only the ...
(damn ... new vscodium _here_ always slows me down .. need more practice 😅)
will try to make simple new peote-sample now to see walk-tilemap into action ... one moment...
wanna test out also what happens if i am give that ones stable diffusion to eat ;)

me also (^_^) ... was still migrating my old imagemagick-scripts to make tilemap (from blender rendered image-sequence)
<:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
oh, you did created a walkcycle 🙂 ?

<@694560611601743893> into `microscopic` i am think i am `found` it at now 😂

you think some thing is not working
And my `mind` is allways open if

Cobalt (sry.. not wanna `@ping` you anymore ...
-> the last sentence i am not sure about .)
"Kha is a low level sdk for building games and media applications in a portable way. Think SDL, but super-charged. Based on the Haxe programming language and the krafix shader-compiler it can cross-compile your code and optimize your assets for even the most obscure systems. Kha is so portable, it can in fact run on top of other game engines and its generational graphics and audio api design gets the best out of every target, supporting super fast 2D graphics just as well as high end 3D graphics. Also, Kha probably added a new target while you were reading this text."
<https://github.com/Kode/Kha#kha>
no no -> pls `vote` on that image (now as you told me i am will really look at it ... and will scroll up to see how many not wanna have it here into out chatplace ... if much 👎 -> `d e l e t e` on demand!)
yeah, <@781745960829059072> .. why do you not start your own one :) ?
and never have something about todo what of nudity is into your brain i mean
also it is a sample for - > using machine-learning-generated `CONTENT` into `context`
hey, its how you are `interpreting` the fucking rules
<:blobmorning:964199767984975942> 🫴
(give your `vote`*lol -> and i am will delete!)
do you not have better todo with raylib or what ?
and please keep it in context and leave your internalized worldviews at home for me ;)
democratically
so lets -> vote!
maybe only into ones of you from USA
hey, but that is no nudity into my `SENSE`
(on more downers i am will delete -> `instantly`!)
👍  or simple 👎
(if nothing better is todo~~)
or start a -> voting *lol
let the king decide!

religionproblem?
(to make peace into world again)
yeah, they have more todo at now
hey.. no problem anymore .. (i am painted it over!)
need to _sort out_ u know logo ?
`things`
and that sometimes
the `symbolic` of that `p i c t u r e` really by me is that basket ....
<@694560611601743893> -> <@231872730478280705> `--`
and i am also only new into SD (have get that "control"-net installed .. but not tested out yet to ->
(i am really tryed to get that out also by SD itself, but then it allways was destroying my `basket` there [what was hard to put in at that place!])
moment.. i am will censor it for you
hey, this is only to show how much of the generated images i am have to sort out (into that basket!)
-> only `python` (onGPU^)\o/
(hx->py transpiling was working superstable last time i am tested for `formula` lib)
anyway 🚀
<@694560611601743893> but all is `python` there you know .... _the little brother of perl ;:)_...
it generates the images faster
than i am can recognize
by using `stable diffusion` here at now i am only need to -> `SORT OUT` !!!....
I mean, how long does it need to find good images into `www` nowadays `? `°
Or for game-frameworks like <:flixel:230369617774641152> (as little asset-finding-tool;)
Good for games where the `editor` is `included` i mean!
but then you can generate terra-bytes of game-assets ( each one only needs some seconds to generate by `key`)
ok, you would have 10 gigabyte of pre-trained neuronal net (what fits into your gpu-ram)
<@694560611601743893> if i am wouldn't be so old&slow i would write the stable diffusion haxe🌉python bindings to let it _generate_ also at haxe-runtime! (on demand ;:)


<@133338135357554688> some new projects ~_~ ^*?
out of `mineblocks` i mean ^^ `?
and `haxe` ?

<@133338135357554688> still into ...`lime (^_^)` ?
still sitting on computer again (^_^) .. 24 at now here into timezone ...
<@133338135357554688> very happy to hear that you and mineblocks are still doing well 💓
yeah, in armory3d you can also have easy your own `renderpath` for voxels i am think! ( its all very -> `m0dular` <- into there )
Cobalt, i am only tryed Armory3d at now and its really easy to learn and to use ( maybe for whats called: "production" i am also would give h3d a chance [there is better 2d-ui then by h2d [both into heaps is into `sync`!] or other SDL-based haxe-support i am think)
Was seen some extension also last days what is especially to help into creating minimalized `pixelart`
(left is HD and vshaxe on the right 😂 )
at some points i am really get it let look like programming-code:
(sry about the _arm_ *lol ... [that can be easy fixed sometimes ~^~^)
a happyhAxe new year \o/ <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
There we have it ...
ha .. my ml-brain founds it now (without img-manipulation) \o/
but did not get it forced to generate some haxe-code in the computerdisplays automatically (therefor maybe i am need to put it manually inside) .. wanna see hx or the logo there 😂
woah, what a crazy `keyboard` i am found \o/

vi auguro anche un felice anno nuovo
generated so many beautiful Stable Diffusion images today ... but unfortunately half of them are not suitable for young ones

good on ships and in rough seas
it depends on the overall design

`haxe` needs your help
You are `good` coder into 🌉
after you trying out so much at now

<@215582414544699393> what `language` would it be?
do you ever tryed to write your own UI
into language of your choise ;) ?
ahoi \o/
<@694560611601743893> maybe after "multipaint"-sample it should be next -> "oneGreatPainting" with persistent-state (to browse a great silverscreen/linecloth one together and everyone can put new generated images into at place) ... wanna use also peote-net again to improve my workflow into (and more _texture-caching_ is need then what could be improve also the old peote-view one into)
<@126172290667773952> i am also will use and improve my peote-UI again .. to keep and make all the new generated free-asset browsable or interactive .. that would be also good usecase for next year
How to put the best of one folder into a `context` to impress someone by my peote-tools ?
Do you think that can be used for `g a m e`-art sometimes ?
(alone to scroll-them-throught of one session needs time *lol)
<@134541475152134144> i am really asking me at now what _todo_ with all _theeese_ 😂

shit, i am have thousands of ai selfgenerated stable-diff images on my local disc here at now (into only some sessions 🪗 🙈 ;:)
(that all only had to be masked, puzzled together again and put into animation)
into next year i am will try to use for simple game-asset-creationflow(2d)
(pre-trained by community)
(so amazing what i am found there into SD-neuronals net-model)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ok1ChTtWQI
like lix i mean (why not some more lib-tools)
i am think all can be there into haxe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8rVye9emdw
-> i am write better a little `lib`
to change haxe itself ,.)
if i am to lazy to write a little proposal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_hCLad2NOw
-> explode ;:)
or my `mind`
how i am can live into trust of that all is not let my computer
and i am really open also for any idea
(i am know what <@525025580106907659> means,,, wanna be sure you are to)
i mean to the -> `b i n a r i e s`
links pls
pls post here (i am also forgot all the time)
... nah ,where is it 🙂 ?
not find there ?
or should i am search the link for you`?
looks for youself into repo
the goal is to make that harden against attackers (who wanna make social `a` to us ;)
lime is also simple to install by haxelib!
(i am generate all my meme by own only)

(all is pure haxecode then .. easy to _proove_ for haxe-natives like us i mean ;)
Zeta, if i am would find time to implement SRP by littleBigInt, do you would use for something also ?
of _well tested libs_
yeah .. better lets follow the `stable` _path_
(protocol;:)
hey, or lets code (proto first) - > our own zero-knowledge-login ;)
not sure what all is going into nowadays into haxelib (i am also not like to code into some stuff out of perl)
for my own i am only need -> secure-remote-password (the old thing ;)
(was build it also often into the past to let help into)
(into the binaries for win or linux there ... or into android)
into haxelime -> never had a problem into this at now
(who knows whats inside there .. i am also allways watching my network [not that it try to telephone outwards ;)])
yeah, i am also not really sure about *lol
do you think someone wanna hack my haxelib password ?
```sh
semmi@lem:~$ haxelib search zeta

A new version (4.1.0) of haxelib is available.
Do `haxelib --global update haxelib` to get the latest version.
```
(this should be -> `eliminated` <- _fast_)
i mean
i am personally also not like the msg haxelib tell me all the time:
of superstable tools what is there already
it needs a `kiss` solution
me to
i am not wanna say :  `haxe-coins` 🙈
over time :)=
who change what part of libcode
and chained
to keep into order
(out of what is into git already)
why not using gnu-net or some later wallet-chain then ?

hey, but maybe that all is run on own server is put all the haxe-minds together ?

[and no one can tell me .> easy to share 😂 )
docker (to keep secure)
into -> container
😢
or that try.haxe what is running
or look at haxebot->migration anytime here to disco-protocol
(and we all here have better things to do)
-> additional effort
e.g. if they change that github "actions" or somewhat ...
my _trustlvl_ goes limes zero uKnow ;)
i am not fully sure (cos of comapanies whats owned the platforms we are using at now)
like how is into haxe.io ?
(more -> target-focussed as we can _believe_ <- )
(cos web->search -> much not useful nowadays and will be exponentiale goes down)
how can i am search for libs ?
(is perl-cgi allowed ;) ?
how to implement all by haxe-only then ?

<@181590552578359297> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLeL4UpULCA
anyway -> i am understanding (would be not the same 😢)
you should make it possible that each "client" can be able to -> _stream in_ instread then!
yep (therefor i am also can render my fractals here only locally and not on maitag.de)
(thats need much of cpu-power)

yeah, i am remember all was able to see also by the web-services

That i am found really amazing awesome (best of!!!)
hey Skerper, do you also have your old haxe->bot-game running ? (where everyone can put into haxecode)
about some -> image - changings (e..g all the pixels what was changed by painting-flow)
i am thinking allways also about how to make a simple `diff`
especially into multipaint-sample
into my old peote-net playing last years ...
yeah -> every tick a new patch
(and -> hard to get synced)
(e.g. if the gamestate is at some point `not deterministic` anymore ~^)
<@181590552578359297> how much is need to code to make a `gamestate` _rollback_ by one or many if there is some kind of -> `netlag` 😂
<@415825875146375168> how the `state` have to `change` into _machine age_ ?
What is your really next goal/plan into using haxe ?
<@985961886459777084> do you also like that `haxe` spice ? (or only put your nose in for first time?)

mhm, i am not wanna make all -> instable here
and is it working ? (or sometimes yes and othertimes not ?)
oh, i am need another little tool than inbetween ?
or is that old X-feature then not working anymore by telnet or ssh ?
to `import` the wayland DISPLAY from one computer to other one ?
mhm, can i am also do `ssh ... -X` same as into `X`-remote ?
(into new [relative new ;)] -> wayland <- also ?]

ah, but not from our air ? (is it even contains ;:)?
cobalt from the ground of the sea ?
haxe -> lib
_*sw`ing`s the jug_
if i am do -> `haxecoding`
🍜
(that ones not come into my `soup`.)
🧑‍🍳
eh, that shit of software (and companies behind)
-> no trust <- by me
(cos i am not "logged in" -> it automatically `deactivates` it ... to remind-spam-me)
and it even forces me to make that `activation` procedure again (wthellfuck)
(miss my old superstable win7 a little bit)
my shitty win10 here at now was remembering me the 5 time to get at account and to use cloud
(never would install on my machine [even into qemu`container`;:)]
what is nothing else for me as -> overextended m$-accountcloudshit for me at now
also cos of minecraft
Bulby, at least i am think FNF only was _weak up_ interest of some little ones into `haxe` language
(^_^ > `3D`)
maybe that would also be _GoodFreshAir_ for `k h a`aaaa ;:)
(time is -> now!!!)
hey, someone should rewrite fnf into armory 😂 !
?
imutable *lol ;:)
by `haxelib` i mean (also via git-haxelib-prototypes)
<@231872730478280705> hey, into my other haxelibs on without code of otherones all is ok! (cos you using littleBigInt -> no worry t h e r e:)=
As i am was asking my best old friend <@272509832421179392> today how is into fixing last bugs into "simplify"-routine into <https://lib.haxe.org/p/formula/> he also told me -> no time 😢 (there is also more important things for me at moment ... anway .. no ones `need` that old lib also really ... or get stuck into that bug)
and to get `absolute sure` everything works as aspected
-> but hey,   ..... who have time for that *LOL ? (to write _unittests_ i mean)
so maybe a `haxelib test` command would be cool ( and also target-specific )
At now i am have to write all into the readme.md (e.g. how to test my abitrary-numberlib by extra `hxp`)
it did run all of that to inform the user that all is ready-steady-go.
and by default , if you install a perl-lib by tool,
into lib-space I am really like the old perl way .. everyone who write a lib also have to write the unit-tests (best before starting with the -real-_ c o d e!()=)
(or is the "ai" then also writing the `tests` ? [or using us humans for -> `training`]? ? ???)
thats at the end is fully -> `blackboxed` --- > and no one can write the unit-tests for all `cases` i mean...
i mean, can you trust an `extern` what was generated throught so many `neuron`-wheels ....
how we into haxe-team should handle this then for "externs" 😂
to let `machine learning`-NEW-MACHINE -> write libs and code!
On other side ... into some years i am sure one of that big companies (to reduce cost! ;:) wanna get it ready also
(last time into armory and python ... also no ones was liked my haxe-generates-blenderPYTHON [it was working100% but not good human readable anymore*lol..any *hug])=~
(not sure they wanna let you -> commit <- it in *lol ;:)
Bulby, you can also generate java by haxe for humble.. UI
anyway -> haxe is haxe and lib is lib :)=
`haxeget` + `haxelib`
or -> into team:
"hget" also would be cool command into that! ;:)
) but how is into someone who trying haxe out for the first time ?
(me get lost into to much git submodules links .. ok ... anyway *lol ...
i mean: `we` easy keeping _overview_
what was inspiring you ? (the old `wget` command on linux ?)
(or wget;:)???
(like that "winget" ?)
crazy 🙂
do you wrote a lib also yet `?
for your mods ?
(need to remember all `commands` and not more)
into haxe i am like the simpliness of haxelib
mhm, i am not sure to use for myself
(e.g. codeberg or anyone into w w wwww ;:)
sure, but what if you point to another host as github ?
but will this not end all into total chaos then if everyone using its own `develop-timestamp` of haxe-version ? (if the dependencie-tree grows up sometimes)
<@231872730478280705> <@215582414544699393> do you using lix often ?
By the way, how many using `lix` nowadays ? (me never get _warm_ there into ... i am also not like the extra `node.js` dependencies there formyself)
(on _serverside_ i am have to say that i am also never used Docker .. [or had to use;] ... would not using for myself also!)
<@525025580106907659> i am think that would be to complex by "virtual"-container-layering ...
at now its really easy for everyone to upload a haxe-lib,
much less effort i mean as creating some git-account instead (into non-realfree nowadays web-hubs;)
And because of "binaries" ... there i am also think it should be more transparent, e.g:
what is `pure haxe` and what _parts_ are _delivered_ `pre-compiled` (why and by what "externs"/lib-bindings [and how to build on local machine itself!])
both is much fun! left4dead is more action and the full pleasure there comes up if you play it together in a team of four

really
you should write your first haxelib sometimes!
ah, np
was it a typo or do you _really_ try to ->

have two displays here at now (one "eizo" looks good ... the other one -> cobaltblue ;:)I

<@985961886459777084> what do you think?
("blue" was also not _seen_ into _nature_ so much at that time)
and then red yellow green and combines
there was only black and white (contrast)
e.g. into old greek philosphy they had no `word` for that blue color
<@729181341182066749> what do you think how i am should change colors ?


*hugs deep
aaahhh (ok then ;)
do you wanna `learn` haxe
-> into _functionargument_ ?
sry, but i am really WannaKNOW N O W ;:)
and why -> "what is a haxe" ?
who is `Alory` ? (your second `name`??)

🔌
*hugs through wire
have a good sleep ryni
(they even only played around there last days as what i am heared from my child here)
oh, here scooltime is over (into germany)
AH... thank you (sure, invitings can be not be here into simplechat)
whats your `focus` into `info` `?
-> out of `chat`
oh, you are still online ?= (i am thought you was going -> 🛏️ )
by the way, can someone invite me pls into kha-chan (into new year i am wanna figure some things out that not is working into armory on hardwarelayer [there is really need to find some fundamental solution ;:])
e.g. by my new win10 i am absolute NOT satisfied (such a mess... any .. stableDiff and optiX working now)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgzSFhjVb4
logo, what is by that -> clicky-simple-game to make all much `higher` ;)
oh oh ( babelfish smells ;:)
you also should write a simple game ... your one by littleBigInt i am understanding at now!
really better for hand->eye-->brain coordinates
or better ... you draw all on paper and then make a simple foto by 📱 -cam
(e.g. for _battlejam_)
drawing->input-device on PC to!
yeah -> PC is good .. .but for that kind of `style` you needa simple
and put your 📱 into 🚽
exactly this is what i mean: have allways a pen and scribble block into your pocket
paint how people looks and are!
you have to scribble all the time on paper also (e.g. if you are sitting into the bus ... or are at the beach ->
(formula still is `hokusai` and `kimokawai`)
(found the borderline to -> superchaos <- at now there into _set_ again \o/)
(of _fresh_ rendered _image_)
<@302211105151778826> should i am do -> `postproduction` <- NOW ^^?
(long time i am also did not -> `react diffusion` 🥲)
<@231872730478280705> or should i am better switch at now to `stable diff` ;) ?
its `up` to `you` ~^
(can also let it  `r a w` and still render the next one .)
NOW: only the "composer" .. or what do you think 🙂 ?
how i am like it
NB: this it the kind of `chaos` (or fractal->`index`)

->finished exactly N O W <-
my full->deep->fatfractal is near to ready
<@151104106973495296> lets better talk here ;)
What was your way before into ?
it all depends .) ... if you find some _workflow_ for you what is _fit_ and also _faster_ (e.g. you need 50 game-charactere animated)
(that ai-stuff can also make depth- and normal-maps for you, so have to try this together with my old sample for 2.5d lighting: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lightning> + <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/normals/assets> into new year!!!)
to create game-graphics for a 2d-game.
i am think its more easy to use that one + blender (2d-simple-rigs and some spice)
And since i am know know how easy to find/create images by stable-diffusion
here most of code-work: <https://github.com/maitag/armory-3d-land>
(or make it a fine little -> `game`)
(but also much of haxe basics and lib-code and all .. anyway, this is not what is `seen` at the end ;:)
http://maitag.de/semmi/armory3d/
the whole year
E.g. i am did created only 50% of gamechar-proto + rigging at now (and armory-prototype)
needs a bit more time to create and finetune
You can also do pixel-art like ... but the models and most important -> animations
yep, i am really think for (also the 3d-gamelogic if you much by own)
yeah, you need 10 times longer to create same amount of game-graphics into 3d
(all super backwardscompatible there into free blender tool)
The cool is that you can still load that old .blend file inside 4 also at now!
mhm, 2.4 maybe ( look at the year it was saved ;)
(most i am liked into graphics-art was the girl what was sitting on the Box)
Its a little piece of art
i am also like if people get fun into FNF (miss some of the old freaks there here ... at time it was getting viral)
_strange hobby_ to *LOL ;:)
(but was need a new computer and GPU ;)
did get all working into blender 4 now (and optiX instead of Cuda) ... the best at now is that i am don't need to patch blender anymore for
-> <http://maitag.de/semmi/blender/>
-> it's a _neverending_ process *lol

why not (i am also doing fractal-rendering since so many years and do not why ~_~)
(and what all have todo with sega and sonic the 🦔)
i am really interested how that name was born
aahh... ok
who is "sig" ?
(oh, is -> "vxtwitter" ... not sure ... not wanna risk that if i am open webbrowser -> blenderender is crashing 😂)
oh sorry, i am still not clicked on the link (twitter not works into my web-browser.... i am should also try `nitter` next time ;)

a really `deep` one i am rendering at now (^_^) -> still _processing_:


(i am was to stupid... found out now that into shader there is another "step-rate"-setting what have no hardlimit into precision 🙈)
still found out how to setup blender to dive deeper into fractal by precision
np (i am full relaxed) ...
the second one looks better

woah.. that was need long to find:

(or even into native bindings?)
haxeui->qt?
i am happy at now what img2img was generating


(really easy to use and improve)
and stable diffusion models
can be also do by anyone later (all keys is stored into img-header!)
all my img gen testing here by ml
or nOt?
Bulby, also its hard to make the `code` run
better send me codeberg link to src (if you ever thing to keep that!)

hey, we had to -> `concentrate`
(like they did for sound some years ago .)
you are really needa -> `realtime KERNEL` ;:)
-> `paralized`
How can i am make my `algoritmhmmhmmmmHmmmm`
(out of "avoiding bufferoverflows")
what i am wonder it how to use the Rust into -> parallele - computing <- is
( 🛠️ )
(by learning that new _machinelearning_ )
ha, now its gets more _interesting_

ah, cool stuff

Nim, pls explain into 3 lines!
-> this road goes to hell


ok -> "garbage collector"
(remember the version->jungle of LIB -> S P A C E ;:)
c99 or ansi ?
(looks liKe `music` notes)

perfect

ok, lets try "phone"

even the "image" stable-diff-MODEL is UNDERSTANDING ;:)
<@215582414544699393>

\o/ ... yeah, pls keep haxe into mind !
how can i am log into your matrix-host by telnet (or ssh) ?

or last days ?
oh, so you coded to much of haxe tonight ?
Alexander Hill (Breadpudding): thats good (what is ip adress?)
(or own matrix server?)
ah, so using logos bridge ?

do `you? `?=
hey, ever gived boost libs a try ?

come on, i am will send you some images to interpret
Yes ;)

perl6 i am really missing ...
perl5 i am speak better then like my own natural language
sure
(-> really -> sooo muchis possible nowadays by cybertechhardwarepower)
try out the old neuronal parallele networking speed on your own computer (or the one you get `access`!)
(and not only for you -> all `students` should get that by `default`!)
(you should just ask your professore at university to give you sucha device to test!)
you need to pay for i mean
the problem is that to get sucha testing->developement-KIT
what matters
(feedback!)
hey, tell that into zig-community ... they will love you!
( keyboard ? ? *lol ;:)
there you know at now `where` and `what` it is

anyway .. it ``works again \o/
the "ui" i mean :
what a `shit`
\o/
everything is  `perfect`... img 2 img 2 img2img2img2im...

crazy .. at last workstation here it only crashed into cycles and never into composer (interesting ;)
(shit that i am not was saving the fully float-range img-`RAW`-data)

shit .. blender `4` was crashing into `compositor` at now -_-
m e n t ....
anyway, the overall contrast is to smelly .. m o
[img data includet]
eh, i can send you also the .blend to help me .)
simple adjustments only...

so therefor -> new colors is need (before ml->postprocessing 🙈)
i am also try to not make -> what all is doing into boring shit

`christmas fever` ?
hey ichi .. -> do you have that main-virus whats called ->

<@694560611601743893> do you `free` or `empty` at now into _feeling after job_ ?

oah.. shit (still have that ... j o b ? )
thinKing?

need a smoke at first ... so some moments need to prepare
not after -> COMPOSITING (the blender integrated tool .. thank you to remind me .. will try that now!)
(boost dependencies?)
hey, no p r o b l em (for you i am will put the ml-ones later into bot-chan;:)
yeah .. this is how i am LIKE it (my old style ;)

ok, now 2048 samples .. .let me not forget to change the colors ;)

we can _chat_ (^_^)
its into the `oven` at now

(postproduction *lol ;:)\o/)
i am still set all to 1344x768 ... so better for stable-diffusion later .)
(and aspect-img-ratio)
only for a better view into this zoom-lvl it needs

anyway, should i am `rotate` now or better `directly zoom in` 😂
and my eyes goes out of window to by daydreaming
as i am was sitting there into  `class`  r o o m
ah, remembers me into scooltime .)
<@694560611601743893> sry, did i am _broke_ the `chatflow` by my shittyFractals 😭
(and to _zoom_ `more` _in_ it would need stepRate `0.005` at now 🤿)
(shit, i am have to _rotate_ about 15° clockwise)

or where to use into _special case_
i am only wonder what all is `coding` into (e.g. samples/demos)
absolutely ...
auf jeden!
*lol
<@525025580106907659> what can be better than `haxe` 😂  (out of missing "asys" into some consistent way ;)
<@231872730478280705> into armory we really need help sometimes into lower-softwarelayer (where it goes to hardware-abstraction) 💓
<@215582414544699393> do you testing them out all (for study?)
why no one using old perl6-grammars for compiler ast buildin nowadays -_- ?
anyway, for what do you are using zig&rust (instead of haxe)
for (^_^) ?
OR its inside now because 99.999% using volume-rendering NOT for fractals :)
Only problem i am have at now is that since some newer blender-version it is _restricted_ to set up a "step rate" smaller than `0.01` for volume-renderings there [hard-limit!] ... maybe they put that in to prevent users for some mistakes ... for me its really `blocking` my old workflow (i am need at least `0.001` 😂)
(ok, now zoom into bottom left area *joy )
more 💦 now at the ends ;)

blenders cycles-renderer is so fast now on new GPU here ( no need to build blender with my patches also cos by optiX instead of cuda it can be using also the osl-shaders nowadays in GPU-parallele computing )
(now a little variation ;) ... moment
by the was -> rendering is ready:
into haxearmory i am often get stopped always if its going there deeper into layer (e.g. remember this as i am looked how to fix problem of detecting game-controller)
"kinc" .. that kha-thing 😂 ?
(into libs-space i mean)
(nothing works togehter ... totally versionjungle)
problems for me into past also was all the lib-dependencies .. especially BOOST
mhm, isn'T "clang" make all better nowadays ? (what i am found complicate sometimes into my c++ times was only that "templates" <T> there)

no time (still rendering fractals)
no, this cartoon i am never watched

<@729181341182066749> out of `haxe` i mean?
(interesting _translation_ 🙈)
or do you also a reverse recursive coder one ?
How i am can be sure that you are not payed by SEGA or NINTENDO to speak to us here ?
hey, but you know how to use the haxe-> G U N <- ;:) ?
and sucha ?
how to climb a tree
even the simplest into nature ?
so no idea of any ?
-_- why you have no idea ?
<@729181341182066749> how to use computergenerated images best for collages nowa ?
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotocollage

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage

(at the "boxes" its okey;)
into your collage
i am happy you did not put that red hats on each of
"christmas theme" of friday night ?

<@729181341182066749> eh, do not let me wait to long .)
good that i am got more familiar again into python (thx to haxearmory and all of friends ;)
<@231872730478280705> into some of `images` i am really not sure to generate them `àgain` ,) [but into _most of_ !]



still thinking ? (i am not sure you are will stay into conversation)
(come one!)
-> `tenor`:
(sry, my `tensor`s going out of int sometimes)

and iam will allways answer by a new generated _sd_
you by copy paste of tensorflow
lets do a little battle
new `religion` even 🙈
-> influencer `priest` ?
is that "influencer shit" ?
*gets _familiar_ into _at surface;)_

(i can tell you how to use _stable diff_ :;)
How much GB of RAM your GPU have ?
hey, and that shit you sell to us here ?
-> S T U P I D memes!
FUCK -> WHAT A SHIT
(or self-created also?)
-> gif <- meme from
gimme the  `source` where you get your
so  `what`  then ~^ :) ?
<@729181341182066749> is the computer controling you or all into _balance_ ?
(by _control_ of `you`)
if your own computer can `do` create something `new`
why to copy/paste something

Alory, you know ...

(software)
(underground.)
ah, same as here .. only me and half is using my peote-haxelibs for 2d
for you alone or with friends =?
okey
what else ?
hm
or money ?=
so fame is what makes you dive deeper into code ?
ah
what is popular into that kind of ?
where do you get the fame then from i mean ?
or the one who unlocking the hardwarekey?
mhm, but do you also the holy `creator` after you did that (is it a "job" or something?)
is there some tools for `? (or do you need some :-)?
and how do you are using haxe-programming language into all of that ?
show me the assembler code pls ! (or parts of)
show me!
really?
for -> spying ;:) ?
did `SEGA` was send you here into our haxechat
<@729181341182066749> what was your last try.haxe sample to see what a haxe is ?
(or `m68` -> any ;:)
how was into m 64 ?
-> into `dialogue` protocol
Where do you all here was give a little `git` into `commit` to some `repo` where everyone is working on .)
i mean into using `own mind` vs _believe all how is_ or like: everyone its nearest to its `own` ?
<@724510814861656116> how do you think about what better is ...
<@231872730478280705>

(nb -> christmasfun for me is -> `save` at now :)
on common hardware i mean .. absolute fantastic
what crazyAwesome tools there is
it even can make from inside to outside
me more `insane` any time i am using (^_^)
eh, that stable-diffusion ml-generator really makes
😂
( not my ones *lol ->
no, i am mean your personal ones

i am will still `stay` here may for some `hours`
<@151104106973495296> good dreaming ;) ->

needa -> d r e a m :) -> _template_ *lol ?
eh, we are speaking here about `operation s y s t e m s`
(for me ;)
no linux without perl !
and its -> MODULES :;)
stupid question: is the linux kernel c or c++ (and c99 or ansi C ;:) =?
(into lib C `especial`)
(or use a standard kernel and all only what is need for haxe-soup ;:)
after you build a kernel for the first ;)!
yeah, this is what i am `REALLY` neeed!
-> on winshit only use -> gitbash!
logo, that token-ring network makes me thinking ;:)
thank you master
that 2-way->idiotism
sry, i mean OTP
and by pass-opt you also need no longer that shitty-2way-fuck anymore
<https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/pass/pass/>
you should also install the `pass` - tool
ssh->keygen
theres its simple
ah, cool
do you on at now ?
what `os` (cos of async-cryptkey generation)
(half, but also to get sure that no one is `manipulating` you or your data i mean!)
for me its only -> `backup`
(without that someone all the time using your data to feed silicon-neuronal-networks for machine learning deep mining DATA ;:)
sure, but you can work together then on same code!
you have full control about then!
best is your own hosted gitolite!
(no one did a sample yet out of you *hugs)
\o/
lib
`littleBigInt`
put on also the sample where do you are using
codeberg is much better logo mhmmmm .) =?
(WORKS totally without any shit!)
hey, apropos, for the new shit i am only using `pass` at now
its async-crypt
(logo, do you remember that old `token ring` network-interfaces ;:)?
token
.. that haxe traces are "problems" into vshaxe)
(not wanna "filter" -> wanna completely DISABLE...
anyway, NB or LOGO .. dou you know how i am can
also suse was a good distro
fedora is cool.. i am know someone (also from that time) who was maintainer
(since debian -> never get that problems .)
(and packetmanager at that time was totally destroyed many of my systems here!)
shit
who still is using redhat nowa?
wanna configure that one now that it know what a simple haxe trace is and what error throw
no no
i am only wanna have `bugs` displayed into that tab i mean!
(its simple haxe trace only)
why it put it into -> "problems" i mean ?
ah, here:
(where was it ....)=?=

moment...
<@694560611601743893> aaahhh .. now i am _haveIt_ ->
<@231872730478280705> some secret disco or matrix chan ? (or irc)
(vim and cock ;:)
oh, where is it ? (using vim also!)

arg .. i am did shit -> now its into the folder (forget the `.` after `codium`
[hope no special haxe-version or something!]
will never found again where it was 🙈 )
... kha tryes to install much into user->folder there somewhere i am sure i am
(last time also into testing new ide here for me was also same ...
now the first conflict inside new IDE here is that it tell me that "kha" wanna something 😂

ahh.. yes.. its codium (better into "naming" also!)
lets try again
moment (yeah ... i am hate that powershell also ... it put "advertising" inside 🙈 ) ...

fuck.. the first try FAILS here:
mhm... local folder is opened at now, but i am can not simple click on the .hxproj file anymore ... anyway 💧
ok (the old `electrobolt`, good choice ..lets try! ;:)
wich one i am should open now 😅 -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples>
do you have good sample what i am should try to show on ? (of the "peote"ones)
moment, can show you (have to close all others here at first)

its allways into the bottom tabs there where also that "terminals" out are
Also need to know how to avoid that simple "traces" gimme warnings into the "problems"-tab there into new IDE (also not tryed the hashlink or hxcpp debugger yet .. maybe at last ;)
Half, only the migration from haxedevelop to codium needs better keyboard-shortcuts at now (F5;) .. ctrlShiftB is to long to run only buildtask (wanna have "lime test ..." allways on f5 or ctrl-enter)
new `operating` s y s t e m _works_ \o/



me also

for what was that ?
https://youtu.be/xbF8WydzO9w?t=972
(cos of old lightning-way there inTo samplespace ;) <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lightning>)
<@694560611601743893> have to try out that "depth"-extension there to use into peote-view-space to <:blobcheer:964199767217410158> (also "normal" mapping... wanna really t r y)
`assembled` new computer hard and (much harder software into installation;) -> works \o/
<@724510814861656116>

(wonder how the neuronal net behind gets that "mirroring" at water-surface ... fantastic)
this `sureal` one i am like.
<@694560611601743893> woah, now after so much of `try` i am found the _really one of best into generation-session_ ;:) thatsItIsNearNow ->




🌊
and fully concentrating into haxe codewater
anyway, for using into computergames it need to be ✂️ out also and fit all together into harmony to !
-> so much of what `ai` can put you on the table ;)





(still trying out that "stable diffusion" ml here on local new computer&gpu--->so a m a z i n g 🙂)
<@508263787489525760>

i did created that into 2012

and all -> GPL you know?
that is my holy stuff from past of time

why not gimme some -> `feedback` about ?

oh, interesting. .... this was after i am _added_ the `hieronymus bosch` keyword into ml-machine:
not wanna look behind me (^_^)
<@134541475152134144>

me feel like speaking to `bots` here into _chat_ ^'^°_~

not work as expected ^^
(the small asymmetry makes it interesting :-)
for both images i am used my old fractal-rendering for the `seed`.. this one:
<@215582414544699393> <@729181341182066749> you both _seems_ fullyIntoSYNC 😂

i am fully into sync with at now...
`freshly` by new c o m p u t e r here ;)
hey, here a nice picture for you (selfgenerated ;)

aaahhhhh ;)
Mhm.. whats this? ... is this bug into discord or do you both really exactly was talking the same:


oh, you need for flixel ?
oooh... now i am an a _good way_ into _generationing_:
aha

better allways linux after windows (windows really try to kill any other)
install debian! 😂
for what do you need windows of apple-os ?
mhm, wasnt there fortran or something into apples bootshell ? (i did that sometimes)
rebooting to run another os all the time is not so my thing
but you could also try to install on different hard-drives (and then select into bios from what to boot)
on linux its much better into that ...
ah.. yeah, than windows- and mac-os will fight on your computer who will get the mbr ;)
oh, apple ... and there is problems ? (i thought thats all more stable there)
Bulby, found bug here into XL-version ... its the "refiner" second pass! (if i am disable it works at now:
so no haxe ,)?
Was exploring also some "exztensions" .. so you can also generate depth-maps and normal-maps .. that would be perfect to use into my old 2.5d-gamengine-lightning \o/
eh, i am full junky at now .. its my new hobby (^_^)
new guest into chamber *lol ;:)
did now sitting here and doing all without batching one by one (still now a new one 😂  ...
(there the "batching" also was not give error since XL)
(that one was without fractalImg2Img before ;)
here into my little chamber :)

i am was sitting last 5h on computer like this:
ahhh ... cool

(maybe my gpu is on limit now by transforming my old fractals for *lol)
i am still brokn img2img batchprocessin into stable-diffusion (testing the XL-version at now \o/) ... so more than one image gimme this by some unknown reason
wow, looks crazy :)

<@694560611601743893> the only way i am see for me at now is to extend the old "multipaint"-wb (old unix command sample)

mit is not `strictly` enough
i am will!

(mit *lol ;:) oder ohne
nowadays for your OWN ?
What `license` do oyu are `chhoooooosing`
into origin ?
or some of `to be a dictator` into mind ?
cos of commercial interest
is he was doing creating the free software foundation
why do you think ?
or the _free c o d e_ ?
who .. the `person` ?
its still a `rebellation` for sure!
linux and all would not `exists` without stallman i mean!
do you not like richys emacs or the foundation idea of him ?
pls tell here (its -> `a`politic *lol)
why pls ?
and all are happy (2-7 people who `really` working on!)
(to get it `run` ;)
who finally wrote it down
not much was changed into
if i am remember back it was also good into developement and all (codespice .)
at that time much was via email-lists (and tarballs)
emacs -< `creator` >- c o d e r
Was also using "micro"-emacs often on amiga at that time 💓
best he wrote was emacs at that time!
freedom software guru (i am like him to [out of larry wall...])
stallman ... yeah \o/
ahhh
i am really not sure what it means i mean (what is it pls :-) `?
if i aM put "RMS" into internet-search nowadays ...
(sry, my short-key lackness)
what is rms ?
to `restrict` enough to make MONEY *lol
maybe the PCRE1 or 2 is not good
~_~
oh.. don'T wanna know what they like into than otherwise
to make it READY ;:) ?
to pay some old coder for some years (or a team for some month)
is have apple not enough money
from scratch ;:)
(or implementing that shit ..
(or no one who "porting" it ;:)
cos of "security" ?
shit
ah..
is no `sed` around for mac who have it nowa ?
hey, have the free bsd )clone( no perl-mode switch ?
*lol
🤹
(this of stuff you are never will forget .)
me still is!
nowadays i am think by `gramars` everything is better (i am only not like that "rraku"->bountyNameBranch of `larrys specification`)
(or the regexps =?=)
and how do you using the `maps` there into ?
aha
({[keep _cool_ logolologool]})
do you ^ ~
the last time i am long time writtN asm code was for c64 and amiga later (ther on 68040 not so much cos of fuckn cpu-cache-BLOCKER ;:)
(and all that `registers`)
how do you handle the cpu-cache nowadays ?
also for transmeta ?
you to ?
rust .. llvm ?
netscape versus internet-explore WAR-times
<@238385878559490048> on os-native (npm) or js into web ?
ah, interesting
do oyu only have to use it for job or studdy at now ?
was lua your first programming language or
do oyu was `starting` into this pl ?

swf still works
k
you?
(never _prooved_ at now)
i am like `collatz`
😆
haxe is only for FNF.kid`area`
for me personally here .)
<@369949680081174538> is the main coach of haxe at now ~ ~
whats going on of what i am don't know .) ?
shirogames?
woah, but looks like -> abstract art
then it should be `stable` for next 50 years at minimum!
hey -> only DO it ONES
whaatts the FUUUUUUUUUUUUCKK
(half, you told me some time ago the roof of where you life had a 🕳️ )
oh, is the `roof`-fix only was a  `patch`
(like on a boat .)
s u r e
sailing ?
(inside of haxe-Syntax)
(double nested for sure!)
and it was working
i am sometimes tryed to call inline ASM from inline C
you can also call inline
there
WASM llvmShit
e.g. into html->web it only was possible to use that
while Rust at my last times i am tryed some stuff into
(you have 3 or more ways at nowadays i am think to bind `C` externs to haxe in all variations)
supereasy
puh, i am like that you are be the old one
[i am only mean the `language` part :;) ofF]
)
( or also gpt ->
is your `cellurare brain` activated :) ?
hey halfwheat my old friend
how long do you coded into (and for what?)
what is the alternative ?
(if the gamecode is `closed`)
sry, i am not so much follower of -> end-products
heaps then ?
(^_^)
...
who knows
So at the end something more comfortable like haxes
default balanced tree
🌳
`Map<Array<Map<Map<Array......`
🪗
to have some kind of
`priority` CACHE at the end
(or `heap`)
`cache`
`priority`
all what need only is a
🧹
really?
(you should change the lecture-theme!)
oh ouh ... "management" is really horrible (all into that of economy isn'T really `logic` or useful `math` 😂 )
also attendance to the lectures (it can't do any harm either :)

whats so _special_ into -> 🪩 -chat for you ?
generated by haxe? (or outwards?)
cmake is cool (only `make` before was allways a torture ;:)
... need to find good silent moment to write something into haxe or to continue the existing path ;)
(me feel more and more only "installing" here ...
What do your are good into ?
(byThWay)
is someone porting fnf also into armory3d?
like old inka glyphes.
(see you *hugs&waves)
`love it`

*huGsDeep
thank you for cool arTonight!
so much spice
🌌
i am will also using all our older graphics-art (and also if time i am try to "train" my own NN here ;)
USABLE;:)
is ready231
if that network-sample
d e f i n i tively into haxearmory
`daemons`

hey -> NO

you not wanna gimme `all` ~~

from _time2time_)
`reconstruction`
(sry... only have the other mouse .. all here is into ->

pls keep them.
for later and all ! (also into games!)
hey.. all really great assets!!!!
k

ok (neew p r o m pt *lol -> dogEatmen ;:)
oh.. into the new you deleted the middele ones =?
(can not using my bamboo at now .. its fully perfect!)
any ... send again pls!
(pls rename the next version!)
(still `saved`)
thankYouSoooMuch
open arms
wanna do make a blender-armature to let it
(so doublesafed)
can you pls send me also .ora
(only 2d plane there .. and little mesh-morphing to let it make fly-animation!!!)
hey Half.. pls keep exactly this for using into Armory textureFor later!!!1
woAH
crAzy
oh, another `variation` ^ °
<@525025580106907659> for my old (haxelime only) `peote-text` i am also see never chance for ligiatures or more of features .. anyway .. it works and looks everywhere same (and other wordflowdirections i am can allways easy implement later on time!) .. if no other one is using i am only build in what i am need for myself at now.
also wegen dem eigenem fontrendering ... 💓
.. out of for what `all` is using into `main` ?
the new computer-TECH also for something other...
Isn't it -> use it or lose it <- `?
np
.)
(oh.. wrong deepl.translation ...
(there really much is mystic for me into how all works without SDL and other things)
Maybe its also the opener for kha-framework someday for me.
Half, therefore i am also was need a little vacation inside of Armory-Haxe (there all is not so "super"-strict into to ;)
its really refreshing to render some fractals or also using the new neuronalnet-stuff ("modern times" ;:)
while often coding so deep into abstract math and things ...
`not perfect`
i am really like that it is
\o/
(into brain of that ai-modell .. it don't know what a `rope` is maybe ;)
into -->  `s y n c` <-- to graphic and rustyness
yeah .. the fuzzywave
yeah (especially the 🌊 ... i mean that gray wave at bottom ... awesome!!!)
(to easy use into <@231872730478280705> s next J A M ;)
(maybe it can generate also some pre-sets or `raw` data)
at now (into all the tests since i am installed it) .. we never tryed out the holy:
`pixel` keyword ^~ there
<@231872730478280705> ? (sry if i am was brokn some _important_ conversation you was _in_ of _following_ here -_-)
<@694560611601743893> seriously, with _that new tool_ here locally on my computer i am think it would be absolute no problem also to generate 30 cool looking avatar-char-picture (e.g. for a roleplayingame) ...
into only one DAY;)
into the spamfolder ?
whats so _important_ logo that we have to _went_
sure
` when the future is 1976` ... one min
yep.. also e.g. to use all this inside of armory for textures


lemme try for c64 ...
and also gimme hope that if the training-data cames randomly from internet .. that not all is lost)
(what is into "dream" inside of a machines `neuronal net` adt_s_
me to ... totally brainy
there we have them :)



moment
ok
hey, your (holy) `prompt` pls now!
(sonic with a beard of rice)
me to
~~
<@729181341182066749>
<:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
What was the `keywords` to generate that 9 batches?

now my question ^^:
<@817154767733653524> also makes thousand time more sense to me to try for image-generation (instead of that all hyped gpt-largelanguage-model and around our holy one ,)
on my plan is also to `feed` all my own and whatever fractaldata inside that training-model (but step by step ;)
mhm... need new "input" for the img-generatortool here (i am never tryed out also into all that web-services around before .. so its really mazy new to me)
`opener image` for your `g a m e`^~
you can easy fix that by gimp to have some little nice
(or that "whateverIs" into foreground left of)
not really fit into and looks like -> inserted
i mean .. even if into the upper picture the planet
(its so amazing FAST also 🥲 .. i am really thought before it would be slower)
hey.. some prompts ?
🪄
WOAH .. i am LOVE that SHIT 🌅 🫳 🌴

no no .. all `fresh from the scratch` now (also 4.3.3 \o/)

aaaannnnd .. there is is:

ok .. now i am replaces "synth" by "synthesizer":
(wanna not try out more into settings of training-datamodels .. best only the pure raw first one for tonight .. its so much fun really)
eh, lets test for "game"-asset-generation for some styling ?
*looks superhappy

also installed `perl` today and all is running supereasy into `peote-net` again and throught the local perl-POE-server msgqueue for localtesting again!
(and for me here sometimes its good to have also this OS to check my peote-libs is running on ... e.g.
anyway .. its all installed at now and i am closed as much as i can
yep, win10 is -> totalshittySPY MAL and SPAM WARE
but was need a new computer n o w ~_~
Also the mainboards for amd-CPU was not so good at moment now ... i am think into future that will be changing
But some of hardware (nanometer) is still much better into AMD right now ... only the good software and drivers is need (and the "open" ones ;:)
also into past the ATI (owned by amd nowadays)-drivers was a farse on linux (since that time i am more using the other one)
also with my new nv device here blender works now out of the box with "optiX" for gpu-rendering (need that for OSL-shaders there for my volume-fractals)
you need at least 10 GB of GPU-Ram (and not all gpus are supported at now .. therefor i am was choosen also nvidia again cos there they have most stable stuff for at now)
was really cool! (never will forget!)
the AAA-opener ...
half, do you remember your old game together with your brother ?

or also this here was good one into generation-`process`:
eh.. this would be cool opener-image for a spacegame jam-theme:
☝️
the sonic-with-the-FINGER
(^_^)
yeah
woah ... i am happy that into trainingdata also is cool sf-data

moment
oh, lets try: "rebirth on moon, synth"
(maybe it was trained also by lots of "product"-photos)

sure
yep .. maybe the internet is full of that
i am like this one:

ok (one moment!)
*waiting
gimme some keywords please :)~ .. wanna test more around with!
(before we try to figure out into finding usuable game-graphic-art for free ;:)
(let me ask my new machine-learning-funstuff here 😂 ;:)
oh, what do you like to wanna eat ?
Codium is really good!
and no more haxedevelop for me from now ....
but any .. haxe, lime, armory, blender .. all is running again and same like before (only much more faster ;:)
yeah .. into software '(e.g. win10 installing) it was more chaotic here to and was need much longer!
yeah .. really *lol
(more time then to concentrate on the code!)
and can generate it into some minutes at now!
hey.. think you need something little pixels for gamejam

<@694560611601743893> i am still exploring some haxe-designvariations

(any .. never change a running system :)
oh, also long ago

against how long it was need to reduce this new win10 to make only what i am need for

(near to -> JIT 🤣 )
my new computer builds all my old samples into 1 second now (each one)

and haxe at all
how is it into Flixel Alory?
... and at some time the `haxebuildcacheserver` is really helpful 💓
ah.. understanding (i am build things into openfl also from time to time ...
How much _seconds_ is max. time you wanna wait while coding to see the `result` ?
(maybe neko or hashlink nowa only 1-2 seconds 😍 )
eh, i am really exited how fast the new computerbuild here (after 10 years) is into haxe and all its targets
(long ago)
oh, last time i am tryed on debian it was ~ 2-3 or so
how long is build-time for haxe on your machine ;)?
(anyway ... i am happy that i can use only for haxe armory and blender to see how it runs and compiles also there)
its allways the same frickeling as before *lol
e.g. if you wanna change the system or user ENV variables
as into windows98 🥹
for "computer"-setting
even that win10 using the same old (nonscalable window)
Funny also is .. that into systemsetting -...
ah, that i am think is better nowa since bsd-base
<@729181341182066749> hey, what OS do you _run_ ?
->the first i am deinstalled today (after second fullinstalltry cos of that "activation-deasasta") was that
`cortana`<-spyware (was able only after "activation"!)
for _presents_ 🎁 ... ;:)
so over christmas i am will render some _postersized_
😂 and finally i can render also into 7000x4000 pixelsize and more (still testing that) ...
some old fractal-files is need only 10s (what was 5 min before)
As what i am tested there (all is still open into case)
(near fast as that "cuda" stuff into gpu-rendering!)
for new `formula`-`experiments`
instead of have to patch/build blender all the time
so i can directly change my fractal code into OSL
yeah ,, also "optiX" is running now (was not possible before on old gpu and env)
`sound`
still test rendering there and how the 6 fans is doing
<@729181341182066749> everything `runs` o lah lah at now ;) .... the new m a c h i n e is _crazyfast_ \o/
for the new mainboard ^^)

also no need of ->

good night NotBilly
np
\o/
(you byed or builed your COMPUTER)
(if to long ago)
install CPU and GPU -> Z <- also please 😅 ;)
come on .. what hardware do you run windows 10 on ?
youre opportune meaning ?
is -> selfregulated ?
?
the "marketplace" =
I am think the European UNION should ->promote <- an own and 
independent secure OS (into sync with new AI-tech-knowledge about also how to defend from that!)
and it ever wanna get my -> `email` ^~
i am feel -> `spyed` then by
(even want to invite me into cinema-program here into my local town!)
(that was the -> default!)
the desktop was -> exploding by ads
last time i am had to use win10 on job (as it really was fresh) ...
(then you ever tryed -> mac and apple *lol ? also ?)
more "haptic" or what ?
(me to)
ah ... with integrated -> marketplace ?
oh, codium or the ms-one ?
(the "rendering"-quality of)
Is it really the "font" why you prefare "ms-windows" <@151104106973495296> ?
do you know the old tool: `fontforge` ?
\o/
👓
-> `ctrl +`
into -> font-compare <-
eh... do you can not render at higher resolution and scale all down after? (before screenshot?)
(so i can easy using old `fan`s to plug on the _sides_ or something into _constellation_ ... that will be fun to plug all together!!!)
(the `same` model like into old -> `machine` again 😂 )

eh, ....
here
`pixel resolution` ?


its all here and -> ready to build into the old case <-
(and for gpu also much more software-optimization is for nvidia at now ...
hope that will be change sometimes cos AMD is really have better
.> and smaller ->
NANO -> METER <- techstuff!)
.. so -> intel again!
but all the motherboards was looking not good for -_- ...
AMD cpu also was ok for me (was long time researching)
eh.. the 24GB all to expensive ...all wanna buy for training its AI models nowadays 🙈
gpu: nv rtx 4060ti (16GB .. hope enough for own fun with stableDiffuse here into next years ;)
cpu: intel core i7-13700KF
mainboard: asrock z790
Do you wanna know what the new `hardware` is 🙂 ?
i will do all slowly install one by one
(it have to be compatible to haxelime and armory 😂 ... and maybe blender)
what vsc community edition i am should install ?
ah
"cba"? (
disabling all what is not -> _nessessary_
(i will take time for the full next week for this!)
ah.. and you also was hardening it already ?
at home
=?=
What is your `actual` OS-configuration
also raspi 2 is supercool with debian (i3 nowa and slim-one for login.. any .. who needs a "login-manager" 😂 )
(and without overbloated WM)
(blender works there ... sure .. all is superslow but not into wireframe mode)
what do you mean?
have some old picturebook here (transmeta CPU with _codemorphing_)
(never linux have to much sized kernel and all for superoldHardware)
also running some 10 year old debian on some of my computers here
i am often did (on serverside) -> np
sure .. but how i am should upgrade by the ms-tool ? (to its own newer version ---> i am only need DIRECT-X-12 also ONLY :;)
(i mean , what shitty OS if even the _inhouse tool_ not works 🤮 )
anyway .. i am think (even after 10 years) that the old
`rufus` - 🔧 did let it -> _boot_ ;:)~
🐴
0x0003204382093F2349UCK...
"this tool can not ... no matter why ... be installed on your OS" 🙈

... as i am did downloades the microsoft-tool to do that ...
(eh, it was impossible to download that .iso image from microsoft-website....

did made an USB-stick at now:
eh, the first i am will do after win10 installation is : 
-> no cloud -> old classic menu (openShell) -> disabling all autostart and unnessessary services! ( 📞 )
and not -> spreaded around somewhere into filesystem
i am like that there is also only `one config` to edit
(and many xterms!)
for me only pure X-widgets and i3 from now
(is that possible?)
both ?
NB: or start with xfce
into i3
also -> no deflection
eh -> 20 % faster into ALL
try debian + i3 !
oh, you can install any font
yeah, its also kinf of GPU-driver (and antialiasing-setting)
on linux i am 10-20 times faster into most!
yeah, absolutely
email or serious stuff i am only do from linux allways
(my haxecode!)
(windows only for testing ;:)
oh.. i am better into linux of system-administration and all!
i am using both ... all the time!
why ?
have also my raspi here (for extremely _fallback_)
(and i3)
💯 (but debian only! ;:)
(will install also new debian there on then ... but better to have allways one computer fully ready here)
i am have also another linux computer here (the new hardware will replace the old one into workflow uKnow some weeks later!)
sure (since 10 years at now)
yep
maybe (also on _second_ monitordisplay)
will install win10 here next week (lets see if there is the same 😆 )
(css z-index 😂 ?)
but one is firefox
wtf ... found some really omiously glitch into discord-electron or something here (while _arranging_ the _windows_ 🙈 ) ->
(we long time not did into conversation)

(even if have some of _glitches_ like all into haxe 😅 ---> best for ME since LONG)
heureka
i am really fascinated how easy is into creating own logic-nodes (to make all  ... also into `mechanic` -> visual-control \o/)
(e.g. into blenderarmoryhaxe you really can `set` your `3d` sound`sources` and OpenAL will -> _process_ it)
DIMENSIONs
<@694560611601743893> but haxe frameworks is -> MANY :)
sure (some day i am also will make the old sound-GPU-synth-sample for peote-view -> html5-compatible)
i am still stucky into formula and peote-net *lol ~~
( <@689869574883246237> told me last time to try out sound also now!!!! )
(and you really need not one line of code to make superfreakystuff at now into 🌊 )
i am think the blender-artists often not using git
maybe `Window.get(0)` 😂 `?
mhm, but how to fetch the window-instance inside of armory ...
yeah
<https://api.armory3d.org/>
should have this somewhere into api
kha i am think also for sure (i am totally newbe into)

sure ,... into lime all is so much easy (some one only was asking into armory 🪩 and i am also could not help 🥹 )
mhm, how can i am turn a kha-application ->  `Window` <-
into -> fullscreen (crosstarget) ?
yes (it `can't` get implemented better .. to run any more faster as it is at now!)

saves lifes!
sometimes a simple keyboard-shortkey help
i mean i am know this from -> `blender-aid`
(then i am not will ping you if i am really need help if i feel -> redundancy while `editing` or get lost of `overview` about how many files affected)
ah, good to know
into haxe-emacs then ? (not ecma..)
and how to make a good haxe-environment?
i know, but can you help me into cock-have nvim addon ?
(since rudy is have to concentrate on code and is not here anymore to help me)
about shortcutkeys into nvim and haxe ?
who i am can ask here nowaday
(and more of fuzzyness)
that `M` was somewhat later into -> addon
and later on linux also was only `vi`
(i am used both on unix also into my youthtime at university!)
into "vi"
mhm.. was that "M" not only since last tens of years ?
... for -> keyboard-short-key combines ?)
(where i am can ask -> without effort <- *lol ...
te
lu
so
ab
i am would use
if its better than nvim into coding for haxe nowa
(on old Amiga 4000)
-> nP
-> _splitting the screens_
and it was o k
anyway .. i am only used micro-emacs (and also into haxe-testing much years ago)
i did forget that (maybe old TrauMatA)
woah ( horrible *closing eyes)
^~?
(so it _learned_ from!)
vi was created AFTER emacs

 my old Blender-3D integrated `text-editor` at now [all there is py] .)
mhm, and all of that "main"-IDEs nowadays not have this ?
What all do you are using ?
i am often miss a `class-browser` -> jump (both directions from within codeline) <- into all i am tryed at now (haxespecific)
(into armory3d on linux nvim is problematic to choose for "default" inside blender-addon-config there)
nvim not ok?
(feels like `lime create ..` 🌅 )
for me \o/
it also autogenerating a haxedevelop-IDE project-file
that after build (pressing button from inside of blender-asset-scene-editor)
what i am really like into armory haxecoding at now is,
(by drag&drop)
(sometimes i am also put all into old haxedevelop 😂 )
using notepad++ 🙈
For armory blender and python at now i am also have not really installed a fully IDE one .)
(by)
we a put in .)

anyway, the editor is not as important as the
is emacs also have this integrated ? (i am long time not was using old emacs father of .. uKnow *hugs)
and that vi is using also now (for haxe)
i am like treesitter into newest tech there
into what?

if the `fashists` _entering_ back the stage again
we will be the `first` i mean
to -> `select` all `minor` -> out
`dictatorship` entering your `county`...
(only mean, you are young .. if sometimes there is
everybody knows it now
(any, its to late .. you already `published` it here 😂 🙈 )=
or make a test-user throught tor servermesh to create anonyme account!
into its Readmes .-=
that i am think codeberg is mean by: `unwanted sexual touching`
who really touches other people at genitale (without permission!)
into private is ok i am think ... but look at that one,
Bulby, what some of your holy presidents did under the table ...
(or look at some influencer-politicans into main-stream-media 🤣 )
who still  `@:keep into non-adult`-state
i am know persons ..
?
rockn_roll
for what?
Will put also some `swimmingpool` inside Bulby :)
My plan (after logic-fundament) is into Armory also to make some beautiful looking _3d-Scenes_
yeah, you will find _place_!
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidie
(minor means for them: not much money to earn)
into kind of minors
microsoft (from you country) at github really i am think would be really doing suchlike shittyness
say it or not .)
(what was 10 years or more ago .. i am forgot ;)
(that was ok .. only not liked that "black-boxing" there into repo-packing-something as i am used the last time)
(if i am need my own git-server sometimes .. i am also would maybe better using gitolite again *lol ;:)
maybe into your county
i am think its more to protect -> "sexualization of minors"
"`obscene`" is -> _realative_!
k
(also exactly words: `unwanted sexual attention`! )
its only for USA maybe

or simplest solution: `gitolite+gitweb`
-> host all on your own <- ! (and change TOS!) ... codeberg have good template and readmes how to install on own server!
yeah, if also codeberg have this into (pls gimme link!) .-..
oooh... `bet`s ---> i am missTranspiled `bed` and you needa sleep or something *lol
*lol (seeYa*hugs)
i am only hope no ntfs ~
where is the link pls (will complain about there!)
oh really ?
<https://codeberg.org/>
(the `credits` will be _ready_ before the _whole game_ ;:)
sure
cool ^^
(can i am using this also inside of `haxe-armory`?)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/bulby/assets>
ah , same as into your avarar-assets for some sample i am remember
(to have more comfortable i am would choose next time the codeberg- _starter_ tmpl)
+ `gitweb`
or best -> `gitolite`
oh, really (why not use codeberg or gitlab or someone `?)
Or will it be same as into you own pixel-avatar-creation ?
Bulby, do you put your _romance_-writings onto git somewhere also (so anyone can _commit_ new chapters or something) ?
?
(the beam[direction] and the mirror-levers .. thats the `main` game-elements so should get a little bit animated to let @keep players eyes on ;)

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/procedural/src> (if you modify a little, it could get look like maybe)
but have to be more like a "beam" ;:)
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/customShaders/
i am also did sometimes experimenting and at first thought about something like that "electric bolt" ;:)
<@374925643990695937> you _really_ should _animate_ the light-beam (to see from where it comes [`floating direction~~`]) ... maybe by little shader \o/
what i am wanna have is:
if someones enters the "server" then it should spawn new armory-(3d)-object what have to include the `logic`-graphical-code ( not sure at now how to give it that "user-number" from the "server-network-logic"-one ,,, maybe that one should do the `spawn` also!)
really wonder at all that my peote-net macro not let all EXPLODE *LOL (not one times i am get `stucky` at now into)
(it have to be >inside< the obj. whats `spawn` to feel good;)
for an RPC-⚓-logicnode
not really sure what would be best into absolute cool ECS object/logic system there


i am just worked on my peote-net-armory-implementation ;)

<@486327776077676565> is armory3d also able to run on `switch`-hardware renderpath?

the longer you are live into NY (or any greater town) i am think ..

(and best ever to _explore_ is i am think at the bottom .)
own -> `biotop` like
great towns for me allways like some -> great Organisms <-
into _migrate_ my _mind_ again
yes, like berlin also NY have much In and Out comming
same as here into (bus to berlin)
me to (on that kind of need .)

do you have your own `car` or by train or whatta ?

aha
Bulby, as i am was young like you i am only hitchhiked between towns and states here into europe (allways get into _adventures_ also!)
(you can also fill up bitcoins and hitchike to NY ;:)=
good, why do you asking ?
Or some new Ones .)
Where you meet your old friends from town i mean ?
like a `pub` or `punkbar` or something simmiliar ? (here is only that for me sometimes *lol ;:)
eye to eyes and mouth to mouthes .)
to talk out of `net`->barriere ?
do you have a place where you meet people every day ?
to get MORE feedback out of here into our booring haxe-nerdminds
you also should try to find some `novel-WRITERS` channel! (into chatting im mean!)
(really sorry that i am can not read to much of engl. inAmountOfBooksize ... have to print out then to read on the beach or somewhere into silent)
nah, maybe some of them likes it to!
ichigo, i am only remember that last time you complained about that you are get _deflected_ while at `job`
or let `join` them also into here ;:) [irc is also ok for me .]
better talk to your team-members on where you are working on together i mean!
or do a little break (fresh air and _walking_ outside of your ENV [where i am would disable chat if i am would be you .])

any, if you ever wanna get out of only minecraft -> tell me and we can code something together there !
ah, i am try to remember .)
do you also into Armory Chan <@215582414544699393> ?
have to find out much by my own \o/
into armory3d is also not much allways there to ask .)
(somewhere i am have to start .. thats done at now)
and i am only know 10% of how all works at now
how the absolute best way is to implement my old haxe-spice into networking (3d this time!)
my mind (sry for that) is at moment totally circulate around
this also,
How to make your `avatar` like `jump` `?
-> think you have minecraft compressed block-range-data there on both sides (but on different COMPUTERs;:)
try to `illustrate` how peote-net-protocol is working :)

and was scribble this at now (only 2 simple 3D scenes)
_really thinking about `decentrale` armory-`connected`-scenegraph at now_
Bulby, after i seen what fun is into minecraft,
i am also wanna know now how is into haxe 3d :)
so the _other side_ can make an _instance_
and also (more important): how to send a fully 3d scene (with all inside) -> serialized-> through network there
my mind is (out of.. ;) thinking at now how i am can `sync` armory-bullet/oimo physic throught network ...
<https://github.com/maitag/armory-3d-land/blob/main/peote-net/bySceneTrait/Sources/arm/PeoteNetRPCTrait.hx>

RPC also runs -> out of the box <- \o/
yeah, first `peote-net` test into armory3d works (at least into webbrowser;)

how do you do into pixel.land?

how much more time is need to create an animation
(no one also _respects_ this kind of work)
animation is hardest of
\o/
nothing 😂 ?
or also
for next day ?
foreignS... what is your plan
(into 3d all is much more complex!)
and you also never really was using peote-view
(armory is all what i am need and more!)
why?
`haxe 3D`
i am for myself like to also can do
take your time
\o/
better try out also by yourself"
don't believe?
and works
its kha
`really`
-> unity is S H I T :)
(also how easy nowadays to make something into 3d and haxe)
try out by yourself and you will see also!
really .. never get blocket by some bug or get `stucky` into at now

<@216710301876224001> i am happy that haxe armory (3d) also is into `sync` with blender -> `longTimeSTABLE` versioning ~~
entering the game .)
at that moment where the bad ones
for me "minecraft" was -> sold out
why not lets write our own `haxecraft` ... i mean armory3d have all what is need!
<@215582414544699393> what is problem into jvm-bytecodeVersionSHIT ?
mhm... that _reflaxehaxe_ smells really good
thats good helper format and into _tools_
ahh.. `md` is fast to edit also _plain_
i am think i will all create into armory there for me at now (and needs some linked `scene`-modularity ... much todo .)
<@215582414544699393> what is your home-page on your new domain ? (plaintxt or html ;)?
🫂
need your feedback all the time .)
(for more easy code-review/share of quint-essence)
at first my goal is to create an armory-sample repo-`base`
that later ...
will make my own little cyberspace there into on my little home page .)
💯 🌌
(if i am would concentrate on other things, i am would ne be here .)
r e
s u
will put on my homepage
not long and i am have a full: Travelling circus ;:)
(for myself -> feels much to long 😅 ... months for only starting a walk-cycle)
the haxe-kha-armory machine has now really become a universal tool!
feel free!)
... if you wanna use my armory-samples for something ->
(but to control chars there by _walkmesh_ and sucha .. thats maybe to much then for me ..
maybe i can model a swim-bassin for you into the next time ...
don'T wanna stop my good workflow into haxeArmory also at now ...
(i am into -> sus pense ;:)
(np)
... needa _translator_ then 😅 )
.. but for writing-stuff ... i mean
(informatic science book and sucha its not sucha bad for me into feel by reading ...
(me need into german lang)
`brainwash` us 😂 ;:)
not that you are from this "organization" and wanna
hey, i am only thought cos you often talked about your mom here

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States
is that same kind of moms what started the `prohibition` at that time `?
something like:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moms_for_Liberty
mhm, what do you mean ? ...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure
where the publicum is `inside` of `act` (not like the viewer of a picture into mind only anymore)
and then about new _theathre_ of Bertold Brecht or someone later into....
3)
2)
1)
think like into Aristotheles art of storytelling into
📞 with _before_ ;:)
yeah ... what also needs is -> inter`act`ion
;)
origin `base` pose
cos some little bug you did -> deforms it all and you feel like you never can bring it back into
into 3d more and more i am think to see it as -> mesh-deformation <-
Problem allways is that "armature-rigging" into 3D really needs its time ...
hey Bulby, and also -> kissing!
if i am have more time i will create more "char"-poses and animation (also _hugging_°!°!°)
hey, its _summer_ ;:) 🌅
*hugs comfortingly
i am wonder at now why into `browser` it seems to moves faster as into `Krom` (my last armory experiment)
ah (`link`?)
<@215582414544699393> do you was joining haxejam? (wonder where all is ... wanna take a look at what was created there) .... for me i am think its also to late now to create little game for into 3D 😂 ...
(maybe next time if i am more know how todo into armory)
(or more simple: only 1 portal only for both .. peote-net is ideal for this kind of!)
and all should "connect" automatically.
3d-assets you simple drag into your scene .) 
... server and client `portals` ...
best into networkabstraction would be into my mind to have only 2 kind of
Really wan't to have this also as "multiplayer" proto.
look how _little char_ is walking there .. like 🐅 into `cage` ;)

(that one of 3d-model with the strapse 😂 )
hey Bulby, i am really wan't to have the haxe-walker inside of my Armory-Test-Suite also at now :)
have a good sleepAtNight and many dreams .)!!!
(and the old _machines_ [terminals] have need to _emulate_ by some  `term` command .)

the last one i am remember was <@891997325499719730> 🫂
into haxeland here.
sure, much is using pure opengl into some ways/frameworks
this is also what was used sometimes by some freaks and friends here into some real usecases
oh, some of (look at github) .. my most longtime thing is `peote-view`
(if you mean of that .)
without need to restart
perl-server was last time run for 2 years (since multipaint test at that time)
?
and it have RPC
(so fast to setup some proto)
you can test all out locally without any perl-server or sockets
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/net/lifecoder/src/Main.hx#L30>

😂
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/lifecoder/
(but still have some bugs and also only into one direction)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/net/lifecoder>
(if no "server" runs already at that "channel-name")
into your webbrowser if you load it into
there the "server" is directly start
or look at other sample "lifecoder" :;)
(into latenzy)
try it (to optimize there is some ways)
(code have to keep easy to understand!)
this is only a sample
sure
and than back (same route) to your computer before it "draw" a pixel .)
its only test-case ... it goes throught perl-protocol-proxy and to my "server" here
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-server>
by this one:
so it goes to my maitag.de host
thats cos i am started "server" here
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-net>
look at the code .. its not so much complicate (or at the peote-net samples or core-tests)

yes
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/multipaint/
wanna test ?
the first test ( where all here was paint something inside together .)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/811292278382395452/951583215519416380/unknown.png
here some lime-samples (best at now was multipaint!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/net>
no, i mean to play into "multiplayer"
wanna try to implement my old peote-net lib at next (for more fun together with the "physics";:)
sure
ah

...ooch .. my char is still walking to fast:
no (^_^) whats that ?
it's only by Armory logicnodes: https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/596744553030090880/1138305842639278110

hey, see you (and wish you the best of... you know ...

at first my little gamechars should get an -> 🫂 <- animation
you gimme much inspiration ...
What not was working into `multipaint` or `lifecoder` into peote-net `2D` i am will try into `3D` at now.
everyone who is -> `entering` <- should get -> `beam into` (have already found some doku how i can make by shader there)
for my homepage my plan (old one also!) is to make a 3d-chat there at now!

into german its the `Teufelshöhle` (cave of the devil)

`C+`
or something ~_+
`-D cppVerbose`
and make haxe-generated-c++ code more readable .)
`messiah`come_s_
My dream is that sometimes a
Or do you need cos of haxe->`bindings` ;)?
how many discord-server is there into c++ nowadays ? (and whats the best one .)
(don't know whats _goingon_ into `clang` nowadays ;:) [is that _boost_ still _alive_ ?]
oh, c++ ... also <templ> ;:)?
Bubly, next what i am wanna learn there is how to make `WASD` movement (and that it morph the charactere-animation-actions while translating movement of the parent-physic-collider into camera-direction)
After `haxe` for sure *lol ;:)
[hey, but you can really do much also now without ANY LINE OF CODE there \o/]
Do you also have 3D-extra-courses you could solve obligatory (or more interest into computerlanguages) ?
anyway ... Armory3D is ready at now (but also can't really test out without sucha device)
maybe into 10 years ~_-> cheap enough that i am can buy one for me...
(really would get that _immersion_ also some times!)
Bubly, or think how cool would be into game: No Mans Sky ?
(into spaceship the "navigation" also is fully haptic into ive only heared about [never could test])
sometimes i am wished also to have a VR-headset for one of my faforite games: elite dangerous
Wonder also how it would look .. if there is many 2D-shells into 3D-virtual scene *lol
yes, but not enought linux-developers have get sucha device for free maybe also ,.)
not enough users for sucha devices on linux maybe (no one keep an eye on _drivers_ then!)
... to expensive 🥲
have no VR-device here to test out (also cos of blender/armory i am long time wished i had)
-> out of the box <-
i am really like to see how good all steam-games nowadays is running on linux
(or to _emulate_ that fucking `registry` -_-)
yeah .. wine also was often tricky at that time (to give dll-access)
(not really `free`.)
yep, thats the problem ^^
(on linux -> a farse at that time!)
(to setup and host my own little metaverse .)
i am only was trying at the time that "second life" was opening its _servercode_
ah ok (some light at horizon[for already writtn serversoftwarethings into that language])
ah, yes ... this was problem from the beginning into design there
(i am never really touched it)
nowadays?
or is C# also able to run the same code everywhere (without .net)
(also the other both .. but c# iam only had bad remembers at time where i am tryed to run something on linux serverside)
igitt.. c#

they wanna get me to -> buy
really i am don't know (maybe i am get extra _coins_ cos i am sometimes using so much emocticons or good `ai`-trainer 🙈 into)
ah .. the new icons (don'T know .. sometimes i am can using them .. sometimes they gimme some advertising what i am totally ignore)
no (what is this?)
hey, wait until i am start my 3D-armory-testscenes (^_^)
COOL

<https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/dynamic-2d-soft-shadows-r3065/>
😂
fastest way is by custom opengl-commanset (and drawing a triangle-fan for a mask on each update)
now sure how much faster "floodfill" is
(and if using echo also for `colliding`-physics, the same SIM can be used for calculating the little light-particles [what all can have little gpu-animated jittering or some other fun .. e.g. also in depend of _distance_ to _light_source_)
YEP
would be using `echo` engine for!

jo
like: _painting the light-rays by little light-points_
idea is to arrange all little lights by tracing the light-rays (circular into any direction until it not hits a surface what makes shadow)
i mean since 10000 little lights is no problem (they are all is rendered into one pass!)
more like this: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/lightning/blend-multiply-glsl/>
(Half, i mean instead of _floodfill_ the light/shadow-area into texture-pixels)
(and then shadow automatically at points where not light is)
flooding all by little light-sources
what i am sometimes thought about was into
this makes me happy (also that all works together with the lime-tools) -.... all like lego <:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
(or only on need!)
(optimization later;)
it works \o/ and you did give a 🚀 -start into *hug
Into past i am was looking sometimes also how to do like this into opengl (they often using `fan` drawing therefor) ... maybe we can create that "mask" later by using the "Custom"-gl-Injection for
yes, softshadows is also another lvl of complexity on top
yeah, AWESOME 💓 
into shadows its to complicate to make deferred for multiple lights (not easy like into lightshading anymore for mass of lightsources )
ah, interesting
OH WOW (first shadow-casting there \o/)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum
who knows ;:)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_bear
(they found cave-bear-bones into caves and long time thought about why there was always one left over when re-assembling;:)
do you know that the old kind of `cave bear`s (extincted at nowadays) ...
really had sucha `bone` for ^~
into blender that point is called `nodule`
😆

*lol

do you still thought all the samples inside of haxe-cookbook?
(afk also for an hour... later i am wan't to explore more into `armor`y again ,.)

(there is a "new" one now.. don'T know also why *lol ;:)
(need that haxe-walker inside of my ASSET-LIB ;:)~
eh Bulby ... do you using blender sometimes also ?
why not ask HBot here?
mhm.. why is there 2 others armory-discords at now
(any, i am joined both at now if i am have questions or to show others ;)
pls gimme your OK 😂 (why no one using cool blender-tool here*lol ;:)
in ?
<:blobnervous2:964199768517652530> should i am -> `drag` <- it
Armory3d is so exiting and improved nowadays 🚀
the cool is the armory-sample shows both ways \o/ 💓 
( also can change the extra included haxe-script-trait instead of trigger the walk-anim-action by visual-nodelogic )
(only have to drag it in ,  assign the logic [graphically or by haxe] .... 
and -> PLAY ;)
new `asset-lib` - feature 🙂
woah ... its feeling like into unreal or unity at now by blenders

*lol
(but the camera also should move around... lets see after lunch .)
need only to replace the rig-asset for this sample: <https://github.com/armory3d/armory_examples/tree/master/animation_actions>
it will be more fun into creating more into my action-assets-lib for that game-hipshaker-avatar 😂 ... more fun then to show by html-out ( also krom target works and all builds into 5 seconds also while not have to leave blender ;)
yep (maybe tonight;) .. still into trying out the samples how to handle the anim-actions
was playing around with armory3d today,
setup is so easy nowadays 💓 (also into writing first "trait" ..
need to experiment with the scene-traits next)

<@151104106973495296> mhm, should i am better switch from your chamber here to armory chat one .... maybe someone there can get use of my free graphic-assets
see you!
would like to help you but aespriteformat is something i am never used ( you should ask <@694560611601743893> about )
(i am like blender ... ichi, what do you created into photoshop since you are was using [i can send you my first creations there into also if you like])

(why you into chat if you not try to relax?)
oh, better let not see our communication to your boss
therefor i am asking you (me not sure also .)
"normal" into youMind? (would use then!)

<@720807971436756992> lemme try also now from the other SIDE ;:) *hugs [m o m en t o ]

to get _limeRunning_ 💓 ?~^^
so is it same into switch (pure `FD` [without of `X` :;) ?
(`fd`)=
or more and more also pure `framebufferDevice`.
while i am using `X` still since i am work with unix-based computers ( most of my life )
`restrict` by NDA or something there...
😅 ... i mean -> hard to getIntoMind if you are

(all only old and cheap components there build into that play-only-device.)
i mean to help make lime and all -> compatible
(really would take control of that device here also sometimes into _familysharing_ but if i am would destroy there something and all others here can not play its _games_ here _anymore_ ,... oh ou u...)
lime on "switch" running all at now?
(newest one ... WHY ZELDA is not -> MULTIPLAYER ?)
how goes on into getting old code run on zelda-console?
any
(net-lag is np for me [makes all more _precise_;])
can i am paint something into by gimmeYourDisplay (throught sshd ;:)
if we all would have a running (secure;) > minecraft client <@215582414544699393> i am sure we could also build something there at tonight for you into your _instance_
(e.g. if i am paint something now into <1min and send you file to put something into and then ping-pong-again=?)
do you have a graphic-tablet ... and is that ps-version able to export to mypaint ?
(is it run there into macintosh-"free"-bsd-env?)
so no `mypaint` ?
([is that _reallyneed_ for simple 2d-gaming ~_-)=\? -- >i am ASKING MYSELFishSOMETIMES ;:)]
(before closing my lovelyest.basetool blender ... i am have to `ask`;)<@486327776077676565>

*starting mypaint (first have to _close_ all www-wiwiwinwinwindowdows)
*plugs the old _bambo_-pen.device -> IN
(e.g. to fast paint some -> MEME <- to explain your mind to others ?)
<@486327776077676565> what software do you are using to make random graphics ?
`words` is also good
tonight (or something into mypaint or blender -> SHARING ;:)-> with you
i am like to code something `really S I M P L E`
(the lib)
do you tryed out hxdoom or what ?;:)
oh noooo *lol
yeah -> or a GPU -> `CLUSTER` 😂 (of many of little RASPIs ;)
😢
(what also was first IDEA of OpenGL-developers into)
DIRECTLY the -> GL-PIPELINE
what cool for WAYLAND would be to transfere
the holy "graphic Display" (over ssh also on need .)
i can here import also my X from mingW of any where Xserver is allowed to do!
same as `-X` i mean by default (more easy there or more complicate) ?
can i am using wayland DISPLAY->EXPORT also throught telnet/ssh?
uni`X`
(i mean: w h y  someone  _s e n d_ -> car into space 🙈 ???)
yeah .. maybe Elon missing its `Y`-chromosome 🤣
(really hard for me i mean to switch from one framework to another even inside of haxe-ones ... last time i am tested kha and armory its so much years ago at now 💧)
Its sometimes deprimizes me that i am not found time out now to test into armory3d (Why it isnt ALSO🙏RUN inside of LIME ,)~ ~
really nice now to _drag_ it into the blend-file-scene where it renders it out for 2d-engine (e.g. have 2 at now, one for normal-map and depth and the other for uv, ambient-occlusion-light and alpha-channel)

hey, still trying out blenders new asset-lib-feature for game-chaRrr 😂 ...

(also into _here_)
(the `world` > `peace` is _near_)
<@133338135357554688> not like `mineblock`s also 😅 !
<@215582414544699393> the `MAXIMUM` i am able to implement (out of some simple freaksamplesWithMyLibs) at now is into `2D`->mechanic
i mean to `dive there into CODE->AREA`
yeah, tested that sometimes (but never get warm up into [to much of other things i am `into`..])
<@215582414544699393> do you think that microsoft will some day change the minecraft-code license to GPL ?
(maybe not yet .. but some DAY ;)
why not doing this also for minecraft sometimes i mean ?
(compatible to old lvl-data also)
i am remeber someone was also rewrote the old DOOM engine into haxe sometimes
(and at best into the programming-language what i am using .)
what do you mean ? (already integrated?)
( `#` is waterblock and `*` is a wall )
```
* * *
*#*#*
*#*#*
*****
```
or into other words: the deeper you dive the more it gets _pressure_ (into 👂 you will _feel_ it at _first_)
.. to let the waterblocks also going -> `up` on the other side!
to simmulate that the water->`pressure` per `block` is _balancing_ ...
and put water into at one side ...
```
* * *
* * *
* * *
*****
```
e.g. if you build something like this:
Also how the water is "flow" could be much better into old minecraft
and all would look much better into global lightning .)
put in some of new "realtime"-raytracing
to edit new graphic-models
armory3d is directly integrated into blender, so it would be much more easy
no no -> pure into haxe + armory ( and many samples and tools around to test and mod )
(cos of that `rounding-errors` after a time ... i mean if you _travel_ allways into one direction)
<@689869574883246237> what i am not understand is why minecraft -> coordinate system <-
is into `float-point` numbers (what you told me last time) ... 
and that at each fully integer there is a `block` <:blobidea:964199768039510067>
best -> into `armory3d`-engine for graphic-network-`viewer` (all into game-logic-mechanic-networking: `pure` haxe for sure!)
someone really should `rewrite` minecraft into haxe again and full GPL (would play/code also then!)
ah, "mc" is for minecraft? (you should write more readmes;)

Is that also easy to install `debian` there? (or how long we have to `wait` here .)?
like that (my lime-stuff i am hope also will get run sometimes there!)

oh, why ;:) ?
(often here into chat i am heared about that old game)
<@215582414544699393> is your minecraft server now -> persistent ?

the more i am think it was a good _setting_

i am like it as it is at now.
yeah, lets zoom into later!

the thing is to keep `balance` into

(but can only test here on CPU into blender at now ... my fucking old hardware)
sure .. there also my "real" OSL will work!
what is this ?
so maybe i am can little bit _optimize_ ... ah .. thankyou!

only if you gimme a last screen of what was the `state`
^^
your brain is also more human as somewhat others->ROBOTIK ones ;:)
for me at now!

on linux?
do you have flameshot or how it is called
pls make some screenshot inbetween!

hey.. that is exactly the "cam" i am wanted!
WOAH (here would need at least 10min)
(how long is need to render at now ?)
no no
i mean blender have some integrated one .. not sure it also suitable for renderfun
what do you are using on linux for video-capturing  ... to look how it "renders" :;)


(before "apple" -> hype goes on again like into "mobile".)
valve wanna sell its own Stereoscopes .)
anyway... lemme increase also the size a little bit .)
(totally into `sync` or your brain will get _confused_ if to much latency)
yeah .. allways need `double` for eayh `eye` then!

(then we can chat while its is -> using blender-render-air-fan*lol :)

you also can do use blender for `stereoscpope` -> out

WOAH ... not also CAM is not CUT what is near to FOCUS-lens ;:)
♥️ 🥷
1:07 -> this is the best!!!!! [we keep good _settings_ ;:)]
(sry.. next time i am will put the correct "tilesize" back into for your machine)

(its the "clip start" of cam-setting what have to reduce)
m o m e n t
(and crazy-> D A R K ;:)
any -> AWESOME -> SHOOT

WHAT ... moment ... will adjust somethign .....
how long was rendertime ?
woah
you are -> game-junkie

(or how do you make it "throught the NAT" there ... pls don'T forget to write some README for your own also [if not for others ;:])

what _really_ happens!

into  `menkissing.gay/~semmi` 🪗 🌊 🪩 ( a weblink to easy "copy/paste" ;:)
gimme also apaches -> `public_html` and i am can put direct `link`
🐚
`ssh` -> portforwarding so i am can logintoYouRdevice and render it by the shell
if it is to _stressy_ 4y ... you also can gimme (like my first idea;)
<@215582414544699393> so is it still _rendering_ or do you not wanna _share_ your _hardware_ with me .)?
(simple "pong-shading" there is to trivial for me... this one can be easy figuring out by looking the best of mass into yt-video-tutorials [only have to try to avoid that `influencer-shit` there!])
(not by "volume-special" but anyway -> this is also part of blender .)
(if you know how to use it you can make all "meme" you are "wanna" ;:)
(blender is also a good tool to be good into life)

(screenshot back is fully ok)
pls let me using your hardware again <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> ~~~

(may we should reduce the resolution for a max 3-min-> preview!)
do you think it needs a little `rendering` now ? (will send to you then .)
(did put focal little bit lower for more fish-eye inside the _volume_ cycles .)
bulby (^) ... `cam` `K`?


then let me try to dive deeper into that fractal
ok, will remember this
do you know how to change the camera (e.g. -> put it into what is the "view")?
(i am will look then what you was change and will work onto that)
back
me
send
no, change camera or improve the lightning and
`response`
-> pure `volumerendering` by cycles i am was send to you and waiting at now for your
it is and have nothing todo into blender-particle-land
(will prepare some more lights then .. or do you already put something in and wanna send me the modifyed `.blend` back? 💓 ?)
(this was only supertricky to implement at now without the new "simm-geom-spice" what creating/deforming/... mesh and other data of the 3d-objects directly)
(and the "hair" also interacting into gravity and motion-force .)
.. i will try to make my old game-char-proto -> `hairy` ;:)
(maybe into some month if everyone was experimenting with the new geom-physics ...
to get use the new spice!
I am more like my old "volume"-things
thats easy now by the new geom-SIMMULATION-nodearea \o/
🙂
do you have idea to put into haxe-logo?

Bulby, SLOW here 😭
and we put the renderresults together by imagemagic afterwards!
so if you wanna we can render something together sometimes (you will get 3/4 of part of screen then! ;:)
there into my fractalspace ;:)
have also found out how is really easy to let render different parts of one long-rendertime-image
(after you found the best "Tile Size" for your GPU :;)
anyway 😂 ... pls set some lights and render to see what was d o n e *lol
dkms compiles all automatically from the "non-free"-sources to keep it simple to update
its all -> kernel-modules <- only (`lsmod, modprobe ... rmmod`^^)
... only did not get that "HIP->rocM" running there out of the box.
but for AMD/ATI nowa its more simple to install ...
dkms i am mostly used
(amd is all includet into kernelmodule it seems ... only the "firmware" was problem today on the other computer here !)
`?
oh, do you not using nvidia-kernel-dkms
(using linux also here but allways on the "older" hardware)
linux is no problem for me
and 4 times faster than on my old 980TI
ah ok .. thats much better then on linux into drivers so blender not crashing
lets not think about (blender runs EVERYWHERE ;:)
(and cos of haxe to see that and how its build on this shitty-OS)
yes, its a shame there (only using here cos of haxedevelop :;)
more supported by software!
(the newest from nvidia -> not installable ... crashing all here 🙈 )
and old funkydriver
have only 6 here
... its some thing how `cylces`-renderer is working there for cuda/opencl and simmiliar,
its using more GPU-RAM if you increase (my old win7 here crashing even at 128 tilesize)
thats also ok (into past blender version that was called: "progressive"-rendering!)
now 2048 or 4096
wow
umvens have better now (was only problem into debian 12 with that "rocM" for HIP -> gpu-computer-stuff there i couldn'T find out at now ... anyway .. all is there using OpenGL-hardwareaccelleration now also there after i am was looking there whats up into .)
please (^_^)
🖖
for "Tile Size" 🤩
can you try out now with 64x64 or (if you be brave 2048 ;:)
WOW... 3 times faster!!!
on the left you see my modifyed old OSL-code (was need to unroll the old while loop there for that hacky-trick to generate the material-nodes by python)
[pure volumerendering]
only the GPU mem there is used! (no "geometry BHV")
no no
(if i put to much here into tilesize it s crashing here also with my shitty oldone)

if you press F12 ... lets see how much it needs (maybe will be faster by higher tile-size into render-performance-setting)

ok, lemme prepare a file for you (lets see how much faster is onto your machine .. here it was need 20min to render)
\o/ YeAH
found a way to transform my old OSL-shader (cos my gpu is to old for OptiX) into pure
blender cycles material nodes!
my one is little bit rustyOld -_-

something by nvidia what blender is using (there) to compute on GPU (openCL like)
(was testing on umvens new amd gpu but there was problem into rocM-something)
is CUDA working on your linux into blender there ?
ok COOL 😍
hi bulby, what gpu your game-machine have ? ( was testing something new into blender to render my old fractals without need of patched-version )
how goes on into haxebot ?
🩲
Wanna be able to give it sometimes also a color-gradiant -> cloth or something like ->
into peote-engine .) [onto 3d-surface after all was _flattened_ 2d-images]
uKnow, its for map some runtime-generated-fractal-images later
(into handmade "uv-mapping" it gets visible .)
i did some _mistake_ into TOPOLOGY while char-mesh-creation

the ONLY problem there is here. ....

and did a little UV-mapping ;)
so i am stopped and switched back to my old blender-workflow into game-char

why you not like haxe so much like me is what makes me sad sometimes
<@215582414544699393> why there is also not much of haxe here into 😭 <https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer>
or that funky `god`->`mode` how it's _called_ into _speech_ of `gamers`
I am simple only asking me why you make sucha effort to let minecraft-server run and not simple give your friends a terminal
Or `cool down` in the Ocean!
Bulby -> `relax` !

*LOL
i am more optimistic
do u think?

i can start render a fractal for you at now

ah, (do u have friends there?)
not let you deflect by my peote-shit while into there i mean
at job i mean (8h per day)

(really sorry about that problem there into last time Half ... its really my design of the RPC macro there)
How about peote-net and pong-game-proto ?
(so with my last peote-event-macros i can reduce code of old milkpiss-engine-code about 50% now)
(it needs a better softwarestructure by nowadays peote-tools!)
(old "multipaint"-sample-starter -> no one interest into!)
only if i am have some really usecase for
by `write` or `tell` to you!

i am will write a great ascii
by SSH
hey bulby, if you let us IN
`static` IP _isn't need_ 🖖
Bulby, what linux/haxe-version is run on your raspi-hosts ?
(4.2.5\o/ .. so `abstract class` should be _into_ ;:)
<https://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/haxe>
<@694560611601743893> anyway, not long and i am will hover up all on maitag.de also to new debian
`bookworm`-version (jumping over "bullseye" then .)
So for non-web-target also no httpd would be need .)
for peote-view lib i am also will using peote-server next time to store some glsl-snippets (mapped to a random key for bookmarking .)
<@215582414544699393> give <@694560611601743893> and me only ssh-access  ... and we try to get it `run`!
(we don'T know until we not trying out sometimes together .)
maybe
yeah, it depends on upload-`sync`-speed and latency
would be interesting to see how much is _laggy_ into running throught your dyn nat then
(at now i am only started the haxe-"servercode" for here at home)
onto host directly!
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/net/multipaint>
`dedicated/`
my debian-host is have to old haxe at moment to let me run this:
perfect then
(apache 2 is maybe to much for)
httplite or something
or you would need a totally performance optimized webserver
better the 4 one
absolute
on my server here it still running since 2 years or so (since "multipaint"-sample*lol :) -> without any restart or something
(-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-server>)
on the raspi i mean
(gimme `ssh` access (user "semmi" pls!) and i will let it run!)
(->persistent!)
(then you can host also things like "multipaint" or more .)
do you wanna let run `peote-server` also onto?
ah, dynDNS
so i am like that name for domain
mens are same as good into that
hey, menkissing is also cool name!
<:blobenjoy:964545740619808859>

ah ok (will try to remember!)

(u know .. thats like "facebook for programmers" nowa .)
(where is your github account by the way Bubly?)
by the way, do you also wanna install gitolite onto own domain at now .)=`?
ahhh.. yeah, remember now also
GLTF, whats that?
is someone using that somewhere also ? (to look and study code there)
<@694560611601743893> this i am have to try out for `milkpiss`-engine-rewrite: <https://haxe.org/manual/types-abstract-class.html>
you can using my peote-event lib for 4d-chessfield .)
(there was NME also i am remember ... the prime father of later OpenFL and Flixel)
yes, at that time haxe was born and much better into supporting also the native targets
at what haxe was as i am migrated
version 2 or so ... don'T remember
mhm (since AS3 times ... long ago)
me to
how you would do into <:flixel:230369617774641152> ^~?
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/uv-mapping-spiral/>
by peote-view you can do like this (+editable!)
(text-engine into flixel isnt that fast into rendering ;:)
oh, for menus i am would use bitmaps
(remembering a movie i am was seen someday where also all was told by perspective of zombie-avatar)
yeah .. 48h is not much
cool new kind of zombie-game from perspective of some of them .)
Anyway, what kind of game is your Plan ?
<https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS>
with deepKnightKiss-engine into:
the last cool think <@694560611601743893> did (into what is "default" into 2d-game)
its all more `low`-level there ~_~
(i am think Flixel nowaday also can do!)
really more easy there also to change your shadercode at runtime .)
nice ( it not have all that game-creationtools, but it can render all superfast .)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples>
if you wanna try out there is much of samples ,,, the newest allways into here:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view>
more only pure Lime at now (+ my 2d graphic libs)
i am only used NME or OpenFL into the past or also nowa sometimes for samples
and also have all the special tools integrated for easy setup a game!
`outOfTheBox`
yes, flixel is using OpenFL and Lime so more targets is available to build for
heaps have really clean codebase ( not used it at now but often looked into code there )
🌄
(Timer there seems different to haxe-pure-ones)
yeah, do you using <:flixel:230369617774641152> ?
np
not yet
into web i mean .)
into flashplayer at that time all of this was also no problem (did that there before also without ANY effort [a codesnippet-starter also was on AS3-online-doc])
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth/wavechunks/src> ( the `Queue`  there .)
I am only sad that our sample what smoothly run into OpenAL is not working also into web-browser
yeah.. remember that also from that time you told me about
(trisitter only works into html5 and gpu-wave-generation at realtime not _realyNonLaggy_ for Web)
that was stealing me my SLEEP ;:)
(can you maybe help us sometiems ... we also have some open "audio"-target problems out of `trisitter`!)
🪗 💋
hey, i didn't knowed that you also using rust->wasm
so lets make it -> perfect <- !!! \o/
[for  `trisitter`-lib]
for rust last time we was need llvm deps to build to WASM i am remember (Half did that cos my linux is to old .)
ah
do you mean all that what is using LLVM?
you can build into C via hashlink very easy nowadays!
(so we not have to worse our time to learn all the new shit into programminglanguaes whats hyped around or is need into some specialcase)
to transpile all our existing code into!
haxe will be flexible enought (thy to ocaml)
the idea is that if any new languages gets hyped by multi-billionares
mhm, what do you mean into detail?
or something like old `CPAN`
(i am think haxelib should go the `apt` way .)
what ones?
my personal problem into lix is that it is using node.js (not that i am would not use on need!)
*lol (hey, nowadays with your haxetools you will get it into 35 ;:)
shit
oh really 😍
snds good to me!
(20h code, 8h sleep, 20h coding again ;:)?=
wow
oh, what kind of gamejam is this?
Where is haxe->rust-target ? (i am waiting for so long at now ;:)
oh, something rust-special?
😂
"gui" is allways a ...
ooh... 😂 -> its _Friday Night_ ~~ \oo/
and as long programmer keeps overview about the fully codebase at all .)
```haxe
file.seek(startPos, FileSeek.SeekBegin);
var input = Bytes.alloc(len);
file.readBytes(input, 0, len);
```
AAH .. have it now:
(after read one .. the current-pointer is one step further)
```haxe
file.seek(1, FileSeek.SeekBegin);
trace( String.fromCharCode( file.readByte() ) ); // -> "b"
file.seek(1, FileSeek.SeekCur);
trace( String.fromCharCode( file.readByte() ) ); // -> "d"
```
YEAH \o/ ... this works at now:
mhm -> `file.seek(1, FileSeek.SeekEnd);` gives error (so maybe 1 is allways added to that seek-constant)
does `file.seek(1, FileSeek.SeekBegin)` means fromBegin+1 ?
```haxe
var file:FileInput = File.read("testdata.txt");

file.seek(1, FileSeek.SeekBegin);

var b = file.readByte();
trace( String.fromCharCode(b) ); // -> "b"
```
this works at now:
OH
there is not much of documentation or samplesnippet here: <https://api.haxe.org/sys/io/FileInput.html> 🥲
by `seek`
wonder how the read-loop would look now if i am wanna start at some position
```haxe
// generating some test-data into file
var data:Bytes = Bytes.ofString("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", Encoding.RawNative);
File.saveBytes("testdata.txt", data);

// try to read from/to position only        
var file:FileInput = File.read("testdata.txt");
```
by the way ... have this now into a test-script what is creating 26 bytes ascii-binary
good thats after lunch here at now 😋
(thats really strange,,,, cool it the dried ones there!)=
wow..that little ones ?
ah..yeah (remember also)
if its going hot outside better only fruits (all kinds of .)
(gives power for the whole day;)
i am like grapefruit after weakup
do you mean because of the name? (just ask, I think minecraft is not so hot right now anyway)
do you wanna host your minecraft-server under that domain?
(what is so secure into i mean if all can be later supereasy _deflated_ by _q-bits_ ?)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnltLPf8KcM
(with or later with TSL/SSL-http->`throught`)
And what would be more "secure" my opinion is if all would go throught a Tor-Mesh .)
i am allways have to tell my friends then: "np -> its `secure` -> push the button to `allow`!"
]
[who is  ->  `forcing` <.  m e =?)
... why i am `forced` to `do` that i am mean .)=?
(only if i am not wanna enable secure-layer into my apache ...
thats some kind of _discrimination_ for me
(or the common-web-browsers allways give a "warning"-message .. so sadly)
its really hard nowadays into `cryptic times .)`
yeah -> letsEncrypt <- is good one to final-certificate your self-signed

[4myF.->🧠]
[into what is _really_ `new`]
( or 2-3 movies )
( for me -> 1 game maybe flashing me into something new per year at nowaday into timestep)
`EXIST`s :;)
that nowa
to play all the `computer-games`
you are young Bulby, so the problem is your lifetime is not enough
so i am code something into `haxe` elsewhere then!
`if`all games are -> booring me <-`at end`
sure (into ANY)
have to play at least an hour or so to get that -> intuitive
(my mind also could not remember all that game-controler-combinations!)
to play-together (even if i am not often was allowed to get control .)
umven have zelda2 now (was interesting also for me)
sure .. i am also only `disable` for _testing_ !
(-> D O N T wanna K N O W ;:)<-
i am totally disabled that `fucking logging` into my apache-conf
<@215582414544699393> <@151104106973495296> how much is `visiting` your `websites` and how do you get `sure` that is no `bot` .) ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHHB7eIxUtk
(git clone; lime test... i mean)
how much do you think tryed that sample out ? (out of halfwheat and me?)
to demonstrate how easy is to using graphic without any effort into animation with that libtools
i mean i am using your `HOLY` pixel-free-creations there

is that `ok` for you ?

<@215582414544699393> what was last time you run the old "bubly" sample (i am put all into "anim" folder there at now!)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFbeNHQ5-M8
perfect than! (pls write a short readme for me so i am can do also into future!)
yes ... only problem is the reference to the "certificate" -> `HOLDER`(->superfunkyff)
([-> 2 config files than! [all out of shitty xml-syntax])
you also can let easy run 2 apache (one SSL and the other PURE :;)
(apache-conf)
sure
pls not let all my `hope` _gone_ 🌊

why you are DOMAIN-BROKER also into @:general * * *
(and why "website" is not §buildBYTHEN?)
... do you also tryed out some other ones ?
<@215582414544699393> what you wrote on your new website, that `haxeUI` is your faforite UI
(here [by _good_ feedback]:)
iam more like to spend that time for improving my little haxelibs
(after pure-installation)
it takes me a week or more to `harden` the common `OS`s
yes (not that it could not bee installes "easy" but all that linux-lib-dependence-STACK .)
would let all run then better throught your server if you install all well into `care` and `hardening` 🌻
own matrix-instances or something -> thats TOO much administration-effort for me here personally
(only alternatives at now ,.)
e.g. to use `php` or something to run really free and social network-prj like
I am sometimes wanna go also totally free of all Apache-Modules sometimes (out of perl5 one 4sure!)
or what is your plan to use for (out of learning .)?
bulby .. or let some part `editable` by peote-ui! (everyone who _enter_ -> should be able to edit!)
(pls make a `/~semmi` folder for me!)
if you need some fractal-images for background or something tell me!
who?
and not accept that : "world only turning around the money" -_-
I am think more problem nowa (also here) is if you are a woman or a men
or any
if you are good into coding
(no one will ask into our computer-science or here into german -> informatik <- !)
sure!

<@231872730478280705> -> forget the old code (after rewrote it could be really look totally different also!)
(cos one of "old" oop-way-lvl i am still have there)
do you know what i mean ?
not sure i am also should give that new "OOp" haxeway a chance
at the end it is all "game"-entities (into good readable haxetypes and combinations of)
also sometimes thought about to use "components" i mean ... and all into -> `Arrays` at end to traverse separate .. but then i was refusal that idea again and now i am try to only make what was worked into past more haxe-4-friendly only (have to make it more easy also to let better extend!)
NotBilly, this is the totally-opposite to any common -> `ECS` 😂 !
(peote-event libs also much into use there!)
at now together with peote-net again (that was point i am stopped there the last time into code: <https://github.com/maitag/milkpiss/tree/main/src>
i am try to reinvent the old boulderdash-engine-wheel ( -> milkpiss-engine .)
(is there no haxelib already for ... as i am remember roughtly someone did ADTs for into haxetypes sometimes)
i am better would think if you implement chess-rules into haxebot
hey hey NotBilly .. how to get sure you are not using a computerprogram-helper into background 😂 ?
(or fun is also to play chess totally drunken _with_ some stranger into punkbar .)
i am like to play chess with friends on the beach

<@215582414544699393> cos of this internetinfluencer we here into germany have no tempo-limit for cars onto the streets
i an don't like that `influencer` (he also is "fan" of -> `porsche`-cars!)
(my first step allways is `haxelib search`)
what do you tryed already or searched for into spiderweb ?
(nothing into haxelib-🌳?= )
or how do you do by python or into javascript by libs ?
how do you unzip normally if there is a "password" is need for (on the terminal-shell-commandline i mean)

it still looks like `plastique` ^^
bulby, you really have to dive deeper into sub->surface into blender->shadernodes .)
...or do you using cycles?)
(best to start into some basic videotutorials .. maybe for eevee-target, cos this is by glsl then for realtime-rendering
you can combine however you wan't by material->_shader-nodes_!
ah, maybe you should ask them or there into community (maybe some other did  emulate it more to original)
(there he is also using principle BSDF)
https://youtu.be/OraUoqy2fw8?t=1121
into industry-standard it was called (later;) -> "PBR" (renderman)
<https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html>
(forget how the hyped "industry"-name was for)
so like a ubershader for most of they are using nowa!
mostly into that 3d games they using same workflow (into blender its called "Principled BSDF")
(or direclty using eevee-gl-renderer inside or the one by armory)
you could try to get same _result_ what you wanna into using blender and osl maybe
-> <https://nehe.gamedev.net/>
why, itsnt it better to create a new one what is doing the same 😅 ?
or for eevee or armory special (by .py)?
(or do you patch blender-sourcecode?)=
there is only OSL
oh, for blender?
(not sure its tangentialspace cos much of fully rgb-cols inside)
this looks like normale-texture for uv-mapping 😂!
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/normals/assets> .. storing "depth" or "alpha" then into the 4.channel
(using same "tangential"-space also into peote-view .)
ah yes, its using 3 colorchans
-> <https://docs.cryengine.com/display/SDKDOC4/Tangent+Space+Normal+Mapping>
coud be (not sure at now .. moment)
could be for uv-mapping or to store tangential-normale-vectors

where is GRIG?
why the hell is that "MIDI" so -> super - i m p o r t a n t allways?

i am think we should make some screen-casting voicechat sometimes (halfwheat 💓 ) -> to find way of lessest effort for milestone one .)
(to make our samplespace really cross-haxe into snd-generation-philosophy half!)
i coud do it but would need maybe some weeks

i am to lazy to scroll up now
*lol
what haxelib do you was using ?
(that can be easy solved i am sure!)
as it sounds to me
i am mean .. it was only a "second"-lib->dependency
what was it ? (i am was read into chat here last days of your problem)
(what need some newer version)
or tinkerbell ?
some of thx-libs ...
i ve read that
np
or into realtimekernel ? (snd)
so the new gento ?
mhm.. can you not be a `maintainer` for arch-repo ?
(here was many -> "installation parties" to !)
(new "stable" one -> fixed ;)
i am will _migrate_ soon
new debian is out now
for me even all binary works over time (i am only buildes sometimes to really get sure)
(into older libc->systems)
not as tricky i mean haxe can be from time to time
(for me never here)
or building ?
what is pain into neko installing ?
or is hashlink enought was tested into every case still nowa also ?
neko is the most stable i am think
(do you would prefare hashlink for the old lime tools?)
aahhh
\o/
ah (works?)
\o/ (wget?)
or -> `canvas` 🤣 ?
or what ?
`ctx`?
the: _everone_

pls _keep into context_
(pls gimme _screenshots_ [like both _themes_])
_intoFavelas_)
(but may more -> `gunfight` there -_-=
\o/ interesting name!
woah .. a fighter game .. like that (only played into past... [long ago]
 "international karate" on c64 and 2 or 3 others there at that time)
(_turbostone_)
both pls ;:)
no no -> armory3D
so what kind of game is into your mind do you wanna create ?
(i am like what some haxefreaks here doing into using there to)
anyway, how long do you are used unity already ?
(also that shitty integrated marketplace there for "free" asset-assert is only -> deflection <- sometimes if you wanna simple get something to _start :;_)_
into unity-flow the problems starts if you try to -> `build` it
why .. thousands of good samples
eh, the clever one only looks into the samples .) (documentation sometimes to long to read!)
what reciepe ? (or own)
(if you mind also is stereotypic)
(and not only into -> `math`)

mhmmmm .... <@231872730478280705> .... so you are also using ?

into downloading/installing i mean?
what you did already?
*lol -> `papers pls` 😂 ?
what half and me are here are speaking about
^ ^
no, i mean into macro-context here
logo, what do you think about game-developing by one or two-people teampower ?
sure
no *bookmarked
[not remember name of moviemaker... will tell you next time]
oh, from austria i am also have some faforites ,)
my _interface_ is mouse and keyboard and sucha
midi is for me problem into _testing_ allways
(and lets make it like "multipaint" pls .)[4me]:hugs:~~
do put in what all the time you missed into the old `dos` one
(keyboard-shortcut-customization [finetunig for the _default_!] -> no problem anymore!!!)
yeah ... lets make music by a haxe -> modtracker <-
💓
`universal tracker`
e
h
t
oh noooo -> you have to code
`tool`s what i am can use over time without any stress or deflection
for me all is like `Model M`->keyboard
(faster workflow after _migration_!)
Its simmiliar to haxe or perl ... from 3 to 4 majorchangings also was need to learn some new
but for sure still compatible to all superold .blend files 🌅
now version 3 is fresh there (since 2.8 only was last great workflow-break)
(then you can use it without any blocking over the next 20 years .)
for all blender shortcuts and ui-fun you need only some years!
(to "add" some object)
(next time press shift-A :)
ok, np .)
the blenderaid-> 3d-cursor is!
if totally new into -> look at first where
(still opened ;:) =?=
what do you did already into blender (have to know where we have to start at now)
thats ok
k
Half, what version of blender do you have installed ?
i am like blender also cos its gpl-free and totallyflexible (simmiliar like perl, python and haxe) into all
.. especially the `.blend` DATA structure behind [whats for programmers more easy sometimes as to find into UI there [what is also bestOff!]
(but the more you do .. the more your mind get open for all and ...
you have to find the `lever` at first for .)
If you like to build up something into straight lines ...
you have to start into some really simple (what also can be used than later into more!)
to keep familiar with the most complex 3d-tool i am know...
<:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
(hope was not much effort -... think it like little jam-time .)
also that you did as simple sample into our code-heap
... ,*LOL ;:)
(perl-server still `running` -...-.-. .- .. - ... ..
you can allways use it
\o/ ( peote-net is what is need! )
ah, remember this
let us make also -> "dual"-use *lol ~-
and 🪢 🪢 🪢 🪢 🪢  -> a `demo`
yeah .. lets collect all samplecode
23 :-)=
🌌
Half, i am only would choose `you` as team-member for a game-marathon .)
oh, interesting
ah ok
by how many people ?
w ow
no
😂 -> out of JAMTIME 4`s u r e`
Half, and i am also think: same into game-creation!
(no fastfoodshit!)
i am like that old moviemakers who needs years for one movie
ah.. getting `access`?
Terry was the B E S T
also top
ah yeah ... or the movie: `Brazil` (bestEver\o/)
Notbilly, half ... whats your best ones from UK (into -> _timeless_ and lots of work)?
(out of the -> _timeless_ director-ones .)
anyway .. there sometimes also some :pearls
for me only Werner Herzog and Fassbinder are ok (^_^)
(they _don't_ know how toDo it .) [my opinion]
eh, 99% of german movies are -> total shit!
maybe also "free" voting is only "illusion" there (after that what all called "great change" there)
-_-
--> directly into the tortureChamber
_maybe they catch you up at cardrive to airplane [form holiday-in-ressort]--
so if you tell what you see is _wrong_ into _System_ -> T H E R E
-> a fully nazi-ideology one <-
there is another great-fashist-dictator now have control (after what they called "arabic springtime")
yeah, if you are maybe into tunesia into hollyday
for you Bulby maybe Tor-Net also would be _to slow_ ;:)
where?
no no (we should thank that students and professores and all who are worked and working on!)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(Netzwerk)
the thing is -> the more `relays`-> the more anonym communication
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)
to `shuffle
(one of! :) ---> give us initial -> _starter!
was the coders
Roger Dingledine und Nick Mathewson
sure?
no , its something completely different into
Hey Agent Bulby .. what do you think about a -> `MEME`.-> generator .) ?=

go throught `tor` then!
nP ;:)


(nice `colors` and good `dialogues` for my opinion after seen some scenes .)
[-> <https://www.kino.de/filme/neu-im-kino/>]
(this is what i am would choose)
yeah, i am like the original alien-movies
mhm, and no "Asteroid City" into Program ?
ah ok
yes .. how long can you wait before it is not valid (the free-ticket) ?
aah
yeah, that independent ones are the best!
the ones where you allways have to think about later .)
We also have some independent little _theathre_ here what only shows
here into the "main"-ones also they only show blockbusters
mhm, there was some good movies at last "cannes"-festival!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYXuDU2Z7MY
Any .. last good movie one was not from there as i am remember ... was this:
nah, whats going on? (i know some good british movies also .)
that does not surprise me now either .)
yeah (or opportunes ... any that human species into biology is also kind of _opportune_!)
What depresses me is that everyone is reporting now about this submarine-accident while the Mediterranean has become a mass grave.
everyone cooks its own soup there *lol
(out of glsl i am only using sometimes "OSL" inside of blender ... syntax is more comfortable.. only used there sometimes)
(maybe you can using this also: <https://github.com/DCNick3/shader-compiler-rs>)
ah, is that "NVN"-shaderformat special for nintendo?
yes (but there also can be used "equirectangular"s)
"samplerCube" is for referencing cubemap-textures into fragmentshader e.g. for a skybox or also for shadow maps (into _array_ to use multiple ones)  <https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Cubemaps>
(if i am would code only for me alone i am would get ->
 -> `stuck`
(i am not using my fucking haxecode `alone`)
good haxecode `find`s it`s _Way_
(no?) -> also "magnat" or what *lol

wanna `keep` _that special `ambient` occluson also ~~_
🌅
hey.. time w    i   l  l _come_ 💓 🌊
need 2 spritesheed-`textures` at now (one for normal mapping and 3d-depthPerPixel ... and the other one for uv-mapping [so i can change colors pp on 3d-model at `runtime`])

(have really much of "spaghetti-n o d es" into my .blend files at now)
32x32 or 128x128 ?
but you know how is into optimal tile-resolution also ?
sure
simple as possible (^_^)
to keep the `asset`-creationprocess as

`blender3DSUPERTOOL` -> peote2D-v i e w
my goal for next month is to make a better

gimme some _feedback_ after pls!

yeah, its -> `fulloptimized` (pls gimme link!)
(only that you know!)
not for some "working"-shit i mean.
its my own haxe-> `creation`

my coding-rythm do you mean?

pls tellME \o/
do you not have something into mind about haxe or coding or into life what needs to be get into `balance` ?

<@151104106973495296> i am think only administrators can `do` that?
all the times here .)
Sometimes i would find cool also to `delete` any msg i am wrote over Discord-chat
thank you (will _share_ the link to my old friend)
(sry, mean the old minecraftworld where the haxe-avatars was manifested into by your old mod 💓 )
7zip compressed -> all easy to _share_
what _handle_ all into _oneFuckingFile_ 🙈
anyway ... nowadays we have also -> `databases`
`make a folder for every room`.)
my old unix knows told me last night into dream:
(even haxe is so complex sometimes ... after my all the year blender-training-wellness i am also find i need to keep it more and more simple there [sometimes MUCH MORE even this 3D-Tool into FUNC .)\o/])
i mean, what we can change here with our more or little haxe-coding-power :)?
(gimme some time and i am will do that into my peote-samples-folder.)
haxe-chat codet inside of haxe-language
the only way
"advertising" -> is `NoGO`  for me personally.
(to find back all my old haxecoderfriends and more .)
i want to `chose` what chatsoftware i am can use
(so don'T worry!pls)
that all is working throught nowadays-chatsoftware was really _flashing_ me up to new lvl of _inspirations_ sometimes i mean
NotBilly, not that i am would like the "php"-wrapper into `try.haxe`>everWorkingSolution i mean
to make old <@661960123035418629> -> _crossChatPlatform_ compatible (much effort i am also think)
I am think you are also only to `lazy` (like we all .)
`any` term
really -> wanna run it by terminal
oh noooo .)
(i am only install things what is not node.js or php on server)
or at end -> will it be not same
is there not still <@231872730478280705> at start `?
(thank you also that you put the `wall`down what was blocking me here to fully write something into the `main`)~_~
ah, we are not so much `diff` then .)
eh, i am never post anythink into FB (even as it was had only 10000 users and my old friend here told me i am "better"should!)
(but happy that the "view" and "net" works `stable` there at now .)
me and my old game-mechanic-proto need a new "scale" factor (will rewrite all from the scratch there again!)
(like into _graphtheory_)
yeah, or a "reference"
hey, np old friend!
_bidirectional_
best is -> `voice`-over-`wire`

(you to 😂 ?)
VederationAtion ?
?^?
?V?
? ?
*lol -> absolute cool ( understanding "region" into there at now! )
(or do you think no one eveR will ever read and use there=?)
(why you are not put a readme into your haskel-source ==)==
ah, interesting
(or like OCT-one into 3D sometimes .)
so like into 2d a bin-tree
is also using `spartial` parting ?
oh, understanding (there is need optimization for sure if same tiles is into a 3d-grid at some size)
ah, coool
oh, so also the random and pre-generated ?
(like the `diff` i mean?)
crazy ,... is this the data what all was changed from the default game-tile-state ?
nah, important is that you also keep it for yourself! (to build up on!)
[-> 1GB -> `much` creation!!!]
hope it will run also into future minecraft versions ( cos of new supercommercial-`owner` at now there)
\o/
into `haxe`
how i am `implement` all into good ( pre-optimized `ADT` ~~ <@726161533540761662> ~^)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bC5Cg2wbhA
eh <@694560611601743893> ... good to be here again ^^
i mean, if you stop server .. can you `export`all what one player was created there or how does that work ? (or the whole world-data .)?
(my old friend here was asking me)
apropos bulby, doyou still running your minecraft server or stopped?
never played
(was climbinG also sometimes into past some roofs here to help to install the little antennas)
we here into town also have our own anarchy wlan-mesh i mean
(-> independents `mesh`-`net`s is best <- ... also local into your town for internet i mean!)
(into `communication` over `wire/satNowMoreAndMoreMasked`)
i am like (all what is -> decentralized <- )
`fediverse`
i am like that idea (heared sometimes about):
or is that all `php` 🙀 ? (at _serverside_)=
bubly, instead of minecraft-server you should install your own matrix-instance (or already?)
i am only here to `spread` my words -> to the _masses_ *LOL 🙈
hey, ever tryed -> gnu-net ?
why do you are asking this and why at now ? )?(
what 4sure you know is interesting me is how you are optimizing your `Array`-Date into haxe->transmutator .) *
(if it then possible cos of to much 🍝 - code anymore or into your `codebase`.)
-> `optimization` -> at the end
hey, *smiles
(don't need also high resolution, but the last stuff i am found to generate some images by words what was _really_ open-source was need a newer one)
wanna also generate some random images over night for some game-asset or other fun by myself here
what only makes me sad sometimes is that my old nvidia 980TI can not handle that free machine-learning tools anymore (was tryed out but fuckingGETfailes -_-)
for me also .)
(to make the computerchips more dense)
there is that -> light-wave-barriere
really ... but hardwarepower not double every 2 years
ah ok .. sorry (my englishneurons not connected to all _phrase_ and englishcommonMeme.)
into algorithm or simple per target-array-ecs-like?
what was your last _optimization-problem_ ?
*hugs (np [keep me `down` if `monologue goes longer sometimes ;:)`]!)
😆
oh, sorry (was need a little `silence` to think about coding-optimization-problem and sucha .)
ah, but its you (^_^)?
an `optimized` datastructure from the beginning sometimes isn't so bad like your flyer told!

(NotBilly *sweetSmiles ...
i mean, the more i am get diving into blender again ...
the more also my files grown up into folders ( 01.. 02 ..03 -> endless .) [there is no `git` 🙈 ]
oh sh... -_- ... as i am _see_ at now i am also put the 2 versions into ... (wan't to avoid that into "simpleness" of how a "sample" have to be! ... will clean up there also later!)

e.g. ... you `open` sucha `device`.,...
i am not like that "hardware-brandings"
i am using what is there and into reach-distance
(our haxe-stuff here is most-compatible to ALL ... but not all makes sense for _eachindividual_)
yeah, lets better using into web-browser !
so what is OpenFL is using to run onto that old one ?
(we are installed linux here already on some one of!)
OH ... the old one have 3D but not OpenGL *lol ;:)

Was seen a videotutorial last time where some one did using accuRig-tool or something.... amazing whats possible all at now!
apropos, for blender you can also using all that webservices around to make your `rig` dancing into all what is `avail` ... any ... i am wanna make all by myself (also not need 30 frames .)

you need animated little game-char what is walking, jumping ...

yeah .. keep it SIMPLE

you need to replace the quads by animated Tiles

how much you -> `replay` ed at now (^_^)?
mhm, maybe like into all and cos i am created the meta-rig some addon-versions before and now it is handling it differently .. anyway ~~

there have to be a glitch into how rigify-addon creating the final-control armatures (or i am did something wrong... wonder how to fix that)
now it have `X`->legs 🙈 (and don't ask about the "arm"-bones 😂)

mhmmmm... the new rig not really fits again 🙈 ... wth i am did wrong this time *lol ...
to make it _hairy_ to get some variations ;)
my hope is that blender will have soon the new dynamic-hair-animationfeature for its awesome geometry-nodesystem, so i can try
but _dynamic Clothes_ is also a really complex sub-category into 3d...
would be also cool to let wear it a haxe t-shirt ...

meshdata of my little humanoid-default-gamechar also gets more and more perfect ..
🎬
into action.
so my hope is that the leg/foot ik-⛓️ not make it _twisting_ by later ..
(now the legs is straight down on z-axis !)

had not so much fun into blender since long 😅 ... here is my new meta-rig-starter for the next walkcycle:
(not yet .. its on wishlist for childsbirthday here into some month already! ;:)
did started from the scratch there again to avoid later 🏹 -leg glitch ;)
i am only continue playing with my Blender-Rig here around
yeah 😆 -> all monsters into later game-experience -> No Problem!
(the whole worldwide fans of zelda was waiting so long ..
 and then they get the _mastersword_ still into prologue to finish ;:)
*lol.. not good for the gamecoder who did that mistake 😂 !
only game i am played here last times was "pillars of ethernity 2" (into turn-based-fightingmode 🙂 ... its nice on hardcore-gamedifficulty)
yeah, not that it also destroying old gamesave!
ah (maybe now you hav eto _freeze_ the game and edit into RAM .)
ah, so a `real` copyclone .)

oh, by a little hack (by tweaking the "pole helper") it was able to get it fix a little bit but something really was wrong from the beginning into the leg-twisting as i am assigned to the rig (before animation) ...
anyway, looks more passable now and lesser bow-legs 🙂 :
(trying to fix after keyframing now ends into a total mess and all goes 🍝 )
_warping timetunnel_ ;)
last time i did a walkcycle was into flash (>10y ago)... 
into blender its much more fun 🙂 (also cos you can edit animationcurves and all while it is playing)

only basic up/pass/down walkcycle at now ... needs to tune ;)

you i am sure will GET it or NOT now .)
i am was give up for some time
its your goal at now without audioworklet

_perfect_
wanna integrate into my (and halfs) peote-sample-repo (for ui-testing only!)
(not wanna make you problems cos of NDE or some shitty into contract)
where is your holy code (i am only interested into the haxe-crosstarget-part)
(no more commit into repo there -> seems on hollyday .)
was reviewing code there also at that time (to give some feedback) -> but not happens
do you `know` about this <https://github.com/FurretDev/hxopenai> by <@456226577798135808> here ?
(may i am also using then and help to improve so ALL can use .,)

i am never tryed the own one inside of Flixel, so can not tell much about 🥲
Michael, i am missed the `rotation` there into my last try. ( not sure for myself what to use nowadays ... box2d, nape or echo ones [all have its special features.)] )
Someone here also using haxe `echo`-physics ?
And how do you are going on mr. <@817154767733653524> - 🪙 :-)=?
<@698153156156194887> what do you still working on into haxe/flixel (still into 2D -game-physics ?)
without `jumping` 😆 *hugs
(works: <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/isktu8looo>)
to let change `frequency` at low latency

all `formula` what is need is there at now (thx to <@272509832421179392> )

we will make 🌌 -crazy-sound with ...
thXtOyOu
🪗
(i am soooo happy that now really soundgenerationsamples works -> haxe-way [fullycross 🥖 ;:)])
and wish you a good sleep!
stay _throught_
yes, you allways can (simple ignore that "layout"-stuff then ... you will see .. API will be fit into your existing workflow!)
(not like how is into html into that [for screen-layout and hacky-things]!)
we can use the "auto"-layout ones to get better
but for mobiles or also for different screen-resolution and D P I
(me also sometimes!)
so i am KNOW -> you prefare the absolute positionizing "fast" one
Also that we used it since a year at now
haxe cool new features makes it all very easy to implement for me.
(you can also start by adding a layout-element only and fill up its childs!)
yeah, both!
no -> to combine
so you start with a static layout ... but at some place (or from beginning) you can put the layout-TREE inside!
no, its peote-ui -> elements (wanna make some basic `layout`-elements to let more easy `combine` [like lego!])
(into peote-ui i am have own one for peote-layout now .. so the things whats need or not are floating back sometimes into lower libs into softwarestack)
remember .. all peote-libs is adjusting its code on what we have usecases for .)
to make it slim and working also into that last (add/del childs at runtime) thing
peote-layout is refactored 90% at now ( i am deleted all that complicate stuff what i am put into last year to make it more change the cassowary constraints at runtime )
yeah -> keep it simple!
k
hey, it will need -> peote-layout <- there !
ah, understand
(or the audiocommunity?)
so for yourself only ?
oh, what is it ?
yes .. for creationtools like this it really need pen-precision!
any .. i am would think about `math` then *LOL
a b s o l u t e
or somewhere into nature together with mobile-phone-computer.
.. so maybe some ones can use to create something while into the forest
yes, but its simple to use also ...
ah ok
k
no mobile-user also *lol ?
also for TurboStoneTouchVersion!
if i am rewrite my old fractalshader-generator (after migration from haxe-ui to peote-ui .) -> we should DO 😂 ! (to get that -> _influenced_!)
Can it using also websockets ?
yeah.. at the end mass of 🍝
until it goes next time online
but its not the cache there anymore ... its -> security-settings <- for "longtime-cache" 😂
only that the user easy can use also offline
it shouldnt ...
(better i mean for simple persistent-app-stuff sometimes as to make all "game-store-ready" or to pass the apple-wall into uploading binary intoThatShit i mean)
mhm, if you have more experience at now how all this works with hacks everywhere into mobile-land ... lets make a sample for peote-view sometimes (^_^)
i did that into pure js sometimes as it was new
i am remember there was discussion into lime-community at that time about!
mhm, but isnt lime generating also that manifest for you to make that js-web-app thing for mobile ?
aahh.. that i am remember (also to install more easy for most.. yeah)
what is a "pwa" ?
Half, we should also put a sound-synth-sample (with some sliders ;) into -> _showcase_ sometimes!
(+ link to src!!!!!)
(avatar-mouth remembers me into garfield .)
woah ... BSOD ....
! MichaelTheBirthdayRatz: or do you also only binary-delivering service 😅 ?
where is src on git ?
to build it ?
(remember on amiga the part II!)
what .. the old `gauntlet` game 🤩
really liked that one also as i am was seen there.
(awesome how its _jumps_ \o/)
AAAH .-.. that COOL THING <@698153156156194887> 💓
Wonder where the source-code is (to see how haxe using HTTP to feed nowa-ml-tools)
Last cool thing into _showcase_ here i am was seen (also <:flixel:230369617774641152> ) was this one:
https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/162664383082790912/1107116084672331827

(1/2 year later -> 8 computers to play with!)
(there was one into scool ... and our scool was the first one into town where was one)
as i am was 12 i am started coding on KC85-1
(could be your grandfather)
mhm, sorry but also never heared about ~_~
(don't know what that is ... the aqua-team i mean 😅 )
🤘
.. to see what its childs is doing here (^_^)
take care .. sometimes the parents or scoolteachers come into here ..
aha
😆
ah, i am thought you are father of Bulby ;)
(i am hope to ... maybe it was to much booring here for Bulby)
`pressing` the -> MEME <- button to often ! Michael  🤣 ?
like into haskell and other stuff
he did cool coding stuff as i am remember (was interesting think into informatic-science also for me sometimes!)
(was he also `banned` 😭 )
apropos, where is Bulby left here ?
about you are learning haxe or why `?
*lol
(until u have the chance!)
-> learn `math` !
(maybe i am should use the babelfish here only if its late and i am to tired [`&` english-brain is into powersavemode])
Yes ... to code i am need a cleanyClearLyMIND!!!
woahaha *LOOOL
we can also switch to the lime-channel (cos all is based on lime-stuff!)
sorry (np~~)
oh, do you also testing our latest spice 🙂  ?
yes (computer is also into chamber behind the wall *lol ;:)
(here on PC and intel-onboardGPU is np into)
hi mr Ratz \o/
and chrome not ?
what do you need there ?
or yes.. how the browser is saving it
have todo with the `format` lib 😂 !
what *LOL 🙈
OH -> SAME \o/
Will be only known after a new test 😂 !
->`audioUpdateLoop`<-
so maybe it allways have to generate a little bit more as what is need into
what me gives headache is that it needs maybe 1/60 of time to generate the next wave-DATA-chunk
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/openAL/src/Main.hx#L105>
For the pure OpenAL-sample there this works already (its not connecting the wave-curves but that will be integrated also into next crossplatform-one)
That could be tricky maybe to have exact _timing_
Will do that `interactive frequence-changing` by mouse `sample` at next (and little chunks into onRender or onUpdate(deltaTime) into some way of _syncing_ )
then better using what works everywhere (or mojo later to better embed)
mhm, have to say that i am happy at now (works here on linux, windows [and will test on android soon!])
How would be into grig ones for this ?
into rust i am totally newby (also never did learned how to write own cpp bindings for haxe yet)
yeah \o/ why not !
(not for OpenAL into general .. its old lib ... but that no one did put it into over the years .)
a shame!
absolute
(hope also its the fastest way to convert for native targets)
ok, then i am will trust you .)
so it keep it i mean ?
mhm... so  `v >> 8` not shift the sign-bit?
```haxe
    v = Std.int(32767.0 * sample);
    bufferBytes.set(i++, v);
    bufferBytes.set(i++, v >> 8);
```
here where i am not 100% sure its correct.
but the thing is
yes, that we can check by haxe ...
chunks-sample will be next (at first it have to be a correctly wrapper!)
yeah .. the Util (totally forgot to use there)
it sounds a little bit different ... maybe cos of webbrowser .. not sure *lol
i am not sure with the `sign-bit`
so this is 💯 correctly:
```haxe
var bufferBytes:Bytes = Bytes.alloc(sampleRate << 1);

// convert data from Float32 to Int16 (where data is haxe.io.Float32Array)
var i:Int = 0; var v:Int;
for (sample in data) {
    v = Std.int(32767.0 * sample);
    bufferBytes.set(i++, v);
    bufferBytes.set(i++, v >> 8);
}

AL.bufferData(buffer, AL.FORMAT_MONO16,
              lime.utils.Int16Array.fromBytes(bufferBytes), 
              bufferBytes.length, sampleRate
); 
```
?
(i did like you was send me last time into direct-chan)
<https://github.com/jobf/juice/blob/master/src/juice/core/VoiceSource.hx#L21>
mhm ... as i am looked into juice now there its different:
oh, but than the `converting` is wrong maybe ?
mhm, not `UInt16Array` ?
oh, shouldn't it not UInt16 for OpenAL + MONO_16 here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/webAndOpenAL/src/PeoteAudio.hx#L90> ?
How is into juice-lib ... also i am think somewhere it have to check what is the Byte-Order ,, not thats inversed on some decives into high/low-Byte while convertion
(GPU did generate for both now into Float32-precision!)
<@694560611601743893> now `crosstarget` soundsynth by GPU (^_^): <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/soundsynth/webAndOpenAL>

need a little nap ( lets talk anothertime *waves )
aah.. (good tool there also [i am totally like `tink_cli`!!!])
( <@695201278405509131> thats what i am asking me since long )
or_no ?
sry. that intime question, but do you are a da_da_ist ?
(out of own 2d-gameever-engine i mean ,.)
for what do you are using haxe for ?
me to
2d or 3d ?
or the `grid` ones .)
oh, so you prefare the geometric -> normale <- value?
<@695201278405509131> how is your `codingstyle` into haxe ? (not mean the syntax only .)
(have to `clean` up there sometimes into `namespace` to get more easy to use!)
(and more near to openGL also into That!)
(needa more simple namespace into shitty things there like: `alphaEnable` flags)
<@781745960829059072> is it ok for you if i am change something into peote-view baselib what maybe can break all of your code into there ?
into a to short `frequency` of i mean (sry).
The only think i am not like into workflow is to switch between the `coding environments` to much over time
-age ;:)
( any , sometimes its ok into python for me to ... after some days i am fully assimilated i n to fully module-u s e
same for me `;`
like into python
<@695201278405509131> how do you are think about `tabs` to write not so much `{}` nesting ? 🪹
i not wanna miss them for myself

into ~thinking~
ok, i am will continue about how is into -> frequencychanging <- at ~`REALTIME`
(to let CPU -> `relax`)
we put code into GPU .)
any
really sorry about that fucking behavior into that ones
😢 💧
so only the old funky ones was give you feedback into supercool shader-tool ?
<https://github.com/jobf/peote-samples/blob/feature/shader-toy-tutorials/shader-toy-tutorials/src/ShaderToy.hx>
ah
\o/
can it be ported down to <:openfl:567735656017821708> ?
how many is using this now ?
hey, but you wrote great shadertool for <:flixel:230369617774641152> ...
better that as into `unity.community`
any
into the past even the -> same grey -> `loader bar`
is looking -> the SAME <-
yes, but thats also why all openfl/flixel games (not all but most of!)
(-> thousands of preachers int yt-andALL ;:)
find own way into doing itself
but really hard nowadays for young people to
mhm
capische
do it yourself
ah
diy .. what is this ?
(+ the 1000 fnf - modders what also `counts`)
i am thought it was 100 who is using haxe *lol
what ... only 10 using it at now ... *weaks up from little Nap
(even old haxe coders and chatfriends here not think `input2action` is ready2use)
`absurde` is (*lol) -> that there is no one *LOL
we never have to let someone make `input2action` slow !
😍
like on c64
or mod-tracker ?
the old tracker-app ?
`humanitychat`
enjoying the relaxing
yeah (me to)
(there also no `kanban` agile helps)
alone you are allways slow into area
so you gived it up ?
lets work together like into last years!
hey, now you will no fail again
shit
so before haxe you was faster ?
([or +- 1 year *lol])
(could need 1/2 year or so .)
should i am write this ?
`turbotracker`
half, lets do it again (haxe need a supersimple modtracker also  ->
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1iY-7ZhVJM
`haxe` > generate > them > `ALL`
what. ... into middle of `Kingdom` - 🏝️ ?
here into small town i am the only one who is speaking haxe
(you have to tell me so i am know what ingredients i am have to get to make some special `lunch` for us again)
(will `cook` something tasty;:)
visit me again ... lets write computercode together also without shitty `lag` of internet and less of nonverbal communication  !
🌅
for me to also was really exiting, interesting and nice talking
(we are one continent here ..and planet at all!)
even from UK ;)
all is welcome here!
before here into -> `Kaff` *lol ;:)
hey.. and berlin at first!
me also a little bit
you was looking a little bit `shy` was first i am thought
into -> `window`
i was seen you from the _other side_ at first
its you who is tell me!
if something is wrong into my lib or generated soundwave
out of YOU!
ANYONE
Half, i am never get some peace or FEEDback of
do you mean <@781745960829059072> ?
Who ?
What do you allways have with your -> `other peoples` ?
`REFRESHED` into FLASH->R A M<-)
(if i am forgot about after some years .. i am only look into the old samplecode and all is
me is need!
we need more peote-net samples!
i know i know
(you can allways asking me also directly you know!)
<@694560611601743893> why you need -> DOCUMENTATION <- from me ?
that is ->
no
most doing what -> `ALL` others dO
(and THAT only for a simple PAINT->sample 😆 )
*LOL
and our peote-net -> TOOL <- running 2 years at now without any `restart`
(i mean how often per day some ms-windows-users is rebooting PC *lol)
isn't that COOL or what .-)
yes, it is `run` and `run` `run` `run` `run` `run` `run` `run` `run` `run`
i mean the perl-server for peote-net ... how long it is `uptime` at now ?
Half, why no one else using `peote-net` ? (everyone i mean can open a local `server` to it without problem .)
-> need a newer haxe-version on my maitag-server !
( we need at first our own "url-shortener" -> lets use peote-net for this .) [peote-server is still alive 🤣 ]

and to invite my friends by my url + key
(like into old multipaint-sample!)
i am only need -> inline-painting or sound-editing <-
🌌
of
time
have
we
no rush ..
k
(some more simple ones i mean before -> 🚀 <- starts ;)
or do you think it needs more peote-net samples to tests 🙂 ?
lime -> mypaint-sample (but all together then!)
(no one other into team!)
we should a game together!
(e.g. last days the `soundsynth` opened my mind .. and also helped to fix some old bug into what maybe not would be found without)
for me sometimes better to find the 🐛
[thats what i am like into haxe also!!!]
about not only `1` machine .)
think like you getting -> `overview`
not wanna -> deflect <- you
oh, SRY then
wtf
or to much todo into job at now?
what is you are working on ?
we should have also not to much -> Redundance <-
(like into old perl pods)
for me!
more -> `Synopsis`
what need is:
i am like simple self writtn words
do it not -> `automatically`!
([or some simplesamples])
(and if you will write the documentation for 😂 )
only if you `accept` that i am doing it as an `haxelib`  at first
<https://github.com/maitag/milkpiss>
`milkpiss` engine again
have to `contenctrate` on the new
let the soundstuff a little bit

no no ... you gimme inspiration to new -
k
`64x64` ?
or
`16x16`
so
something `new` also would make me happy
yes, why not
key
a demo ?
)
🌌
into
(any if we doing GPU soundsynth or texture-synth -> we are `a l o n e`
`haxe` is -> `non-existent` so simple it is .)
ah, K
writing libs what others also can use maybe ?
no time for =
~
2022/2023
(by YOU)
(also other DEMOS!!!!)
-> turbostone <- EDITOR
what i am liket TOTALLY was
why no one using it ?
(how is into juice?=)
how do you would ?
-> to TRY <-
before git-clone out the REAL samples!
all codeingfreak look shortly over the README (for samplecode there...)
before get `usuable`
.. i mean ... to -> `try out`
if you explore a new lib ... what do you look after the Readme ?
a lot!
what is _fishing_
only if you have a good website maybe .)
WILL TRY <- ;:)
-> NO ONE
if you not good document your code or have enough of samples
i am think
so what is that ->  `Michigan` one then ?
depends on GPL 2 or 3
don't tell me
(not your code what y only code for Y->np!)
( i mean that `all` can using also into `future` our `free` software `TOOLS` )
np
(if you wanna have my libs into GPL -> NP <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>  )
more into GPL (^_^) ?
so you think i am should keep my code also more -> secretly ?
so only for yourself?
so thats why you not wrote a lib yet ?
What kind of game i should write ?
sure (np)
i am only happy if i am getting old -> game-engine <- `run` again!
So what do you plan into using all of haxelibs ?
ADT (abstract data 🌳)
🪢
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-event>
(+ better peote-event lib for!)
new -> ADT
no
not sure .. wanna make my old milkpiss-game-mechanic engine also get run again sometimes .)
have also to finish sometimes old peote-sample for .. into let the physic-engine run some slower into timestep of gameloop
yes, absolutely
(i am really liked it)
with the `contact`->events also!
cool into echo is that is so `pure` into all (and using the haxe-features)
( after i am tryed out all the samples and something still not happens [like `rotation around center of mass` 😂 ] )
( i am only would build up on echo-engine into at now if the creator show me the way )
yes, why not
(if all not helps we can also allways using the old box2d.)
no , <@219159860955054081> will comfort about i am sure
yeah .. we also have `echo` at now .)
(where into Nape-Physics it would be more complicate to make it ready for new haxe as into BHX)
(or same into old Nape)
code is still there -> only need to update
yes .. or look like pure lime 3d engine like -> `bhx`
(and Compiler -> fully environment -> makefile .)
(into pure C e.g. it depends on -> Compiler .)
sure , but whats if you wanna run an 10 years old samplecode again to build up on ?
the `peote-sample` repo i am keep allways -> up to date to all -> fucking-dependencies into hardware or whatever!
(need to write more fuckingdocumentation what is simple to understand there or more Readme...any 😢 )=
not after it is `manifested` into holy `haxelib` 🗻
ok, then `alphaEnable` will be -> _renamed_ soon there into namespace!
I am really don't wanna make so much `effort` i mean into all of your code into repos there 😅
<@694560611601743893> should i `change` the API a `last time` ?
(i mean -> putting into haxelib <- after docu->Synopsis<- is `steady`?)
we not `sell` our engine before using IN and Out or what ?
(same as into -> `visual`!)

(like `any`!)
all `peote` libs needs its time to understand also!
-> time for peote-view `aid` then!

is that more easy cross-platform?
oh, then you are knowing Rob my old friend to 💓 ?
what do you wanna `trade` with i am `asking me`

<@511525288291598336> sorry for what my old friend Halfwheat was saying to you ;:)
*LOL
(Coach/NFT->influencer *LOL ;:)
VincentKadar need a > `t.me` *lol
ooh.. `hx-react` then ?
what, a _trading_ app ? (haxe-ui?)
any, we are not `coding` at now .)
(blowing up the code only)
to much to -> `scroll`
(then remove all the empty linespacers pls .)
what isn't -> public <- yet ?
to get that old source code run again ?
so you will -> reanimate <- it ?

i am would not put empty space between each of _property_
i mean between the lines
<https://github.com/Jarrio/IsoWorld/blob/master/source/system/entities/physics/Body.hx#L15>
wonder why you put a `space` into properties here
cool old <:flixel:230369617774641152> style
or same ?
?
`const`
would you name the folder now:

i am thought -> `constraints` *LOL
-> constants :-)
oooh...
why you name: `constrants` ?
<https://github.com/Jarrio/IsoWorld/tree/master/source/system>
oh, flixel -> cool!
wasn't it into haxe ?
why?
proto
of your sample
where is link to haxecode ?
( for cool new isometric protos or orthonormale perspective cam sets ,)
( i mean `peote-samples` repo is allways _open_ 🌅 )
if you wanna we can _reimplement_ it also by peote-view 🪢
(thats i mean what peote-view NOT can do [ your isometric one is np! ])
(or at least for real -> shadow-buffering-stuff .... at that point its to much for one alone!)
e.g. at the moment someone need -> real 3d-lightning .. i am only would use engines like armory3d
( to make dynamic lights + shadows -> time ^ 3 )
i am believe
really cool !
and logically `describe`
to _make it smooth_ ;:)
thats ok .. but real 3d-surfaces > neverendinGstory
-> NEVER <-
do you ever tryed out 3d-math ?
(know _bymyself_ where to stop [and even `2d`-formulas is sometimes to much for an `lonely`-🧠)
there is to much `3d` for me at now <@151104106973495296> !
(^^)

-> would instantly switch all computers here to debian into that case!
(without to have that virusystem on your hardware i mean)
(or to test that windows -> shitty `gpu-drivers` or `audio-device`-once)
wonder how much is performance there into peote-view i mean
into virtual-testing-machine i mean?
for -> testing <- i mean
sound slower than graphics ?
what ..- really *lol
into that win7vm-`jail` i mean ?
question byside .. is also OpenGL working .) ?
really .. i am thought your computer lacks into even FPS ?

never on -> holy `serverside`
or "virtual"-box
was using only qemu sometimes into the past as that `VM`-hype and ☁️ was starting
(i am also not really trusting docker)
for me all that is not secure enough
\perfect/
_thats_ anotherTalk
oh, haxe is generating the php ?
yes .. php -> i am really not wanna do that language anymore (had to do to much shit into for job to get bread here into the past times)
Anyway ... i am really have to use -> non-conform-> PEOTE -> N E T *LOL (no one out of us will understand then later .)
i am sure also you can explore the docker-ENV by some tricky macros there .)
apache 2 ?
<https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/try.haxe.org>
<@694560611601743893> or simplest way for me at now is to create new peote-net sample for .)
and to send it by a web-link to friends .)
to play around!
but to store all the code by a simple `key`->bookmark<- at first
or same for `haxe` scripts like into try.haxe (but first only for > `hscipt` .. thats not need the compiler!)
e.g. to have own glsl-sandbox for peote-view
(not sure what try.haxe is using but for me there is to much `docker` and `php` boilerplate .)
to store `code` per `key`
What i am wanna do sometimes really is to write a new perl-> apache-mod <- one
(faster also and more simple!)
mhm, but isn't it not better to write a new one from the scratch ?
(wonder whats the prj. you are working on at now)
so no more need an extra-filter for what you call "bad code" into parsing out for sandboxing i mean
Or why not using http(s)-service from try.haxe directly and only _channeling_ the _msg_ throught to chat I/O here ?
(you are really should integrate something to let test out macros!)
<@151104106973495296> still working on to improve ?
or into heart->operation 😍 ?
by the way ... is `!run` not working anymore ?
ah, funny ~~ (let the kids pls play around here [ -> pls not ban or `mute` them to!])
at now .)
QPU
(cos into wave-form-physic an `electron` also can `jump` to the next
`ENERGY`>level very easy and without need of any `TIME` ^-^
 ...`qbit` also can have many states  ... but we have no

if you wann i let this little _roundingerror_ inside (if really not can be recogniced by ear later!)
<@694560611601743893> `Math` only _try_ to describe the `physical world`
😂 🌅
( my math is not sufficient anymore 😭 )
.. the `curve` need to remain -> `steady` ~^
<@694560611601743893> i am really should `ask` <@272509832421179392> about how i can solve for our little crazy sampleChamber... 🎼 🗜️ 🎢
( e.g. where value goes into infinity and then came back from the other side ... is that contineously without "jumps" inbetween i mean )
... to long ago ~_~ )
( there was sometimes `places` into curve what was -> irregular <- or something ... can't really remember ..
( i am only roughtly remember into "curve-discussion"-lessons as i am was young)
<@694560611601743893> or is `any` soundwave also a `polynom` ?
generate then continuely `sound-curve` by many of parameters what can be easy adjusted then later
But to long ago for me to can sure tell you that it can also
is easy to _aproximate_ by
or some other into trigonometric complex to calculate things
So e.g. you can transform the `sinus` into a never-ending `taylor-series`
the thing is that by taylor you can express `ANY` polynom !
( there is simmiliar also for "product" over `n`)

(over `n`.)
(only something is "add/del" over time into "value"!)
its -> series
<@694560611601743893> still into code 🤩 with mind ?
[but maybe i am totally wrong into 🥺  .. my playing into only math is really long ago i mean and maybe something wasn'T really _finished_ there into so now i am can not go any further i am feel sometimes]
(and by using this it would be also no problem to _contineously_ change the "formula"-params.
 thats what have nesting into my brain since long at now .)
to calculate the `sin` trigonometric approximations
i mean internally this is also what cpu/gpu chips on computer hardware (fpu-unit) using

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series
-> more how to use it only <-
Also into that video there is not much explained about the `Math` behind ...
( `Derivate` -> np <- )
and this is even into old `formula-lib` some -> super hard to resolve problem <- then
there he using sometimes the really hard to solve -> `Integral` at some points...
https://youtu.be/hQYtRhQPcyY?t=106
Also into video here i am was listening to get more ideas into ...
is great 😅 (or i am to stupid!)
and the problem to calculate math-"series" into parallele on GPU
(hard to translate into english for me!)
From kind of math i am really feel i need that old `Taylor` set now ( instead of simple "shifting" the curve-chunks i mean )
yeah, -> 🌌 <- ... my goal is to make experimental sandbox for also some day !
oh.. is haxebot offline (^_^) ?
absolute (thats what fascinating me)
into all is -> `#PI`
me <- only can play 1 part of gnossienne on piano (was need -> years <- at now and still not perfect 🙈 )
I mean you play the `cello` ..
e.g. like `Abiboss` \o/
or think into what cool sound is created by some artists nowaday ..
Jimmy Hendrix also -> never learned that "system" and even did created good to listen music!
why the hell not "abcdefg ..." *lol
to 🎶 ---> notation <----
😂 i mean (for me) allways was fully stupid at that time of first contact into scool
(for me that wasn't really logic all the time since into scool-lessons about)
how to `combine` the musical notes into octaves and whatever i mean
its an own -> `science`
e.g. here into europa most is using: "cdefg .. ahc"
why something all think is : "sound harmonic"
or into "music" there into general ...
is that -> polyphony <- later ( to stack multiple frequency ones )
what interesting into soundsynthese for me also is
*hugs deep
For peote-ui ->layout<- i am also still thinking again (now how to mix all together with the well tested already working "static fast"-positioning and all there)
If both is not optimal into API we have to make our own into haxe-style!
(for me all is new land into audio-processing 😅 )
Do you more like the OpenAL-API or the one of web-audio with that "nodes"-behavior ?
Hope i am can help you also sometimes into your sound-lib 🌅 !
(both will maybe break some of code-samples *lol 🙈 ...but i will fix them all .. thats no problem!)
(now there is only need to put into better `blend`-feature and more easy to use Texture-params!)
Also peote-view is growing each time we did creating something together ♥️ !
to have something like a `Theremin` where e.g. the mouse-position can be INPUT and without latency it should change the wavegeneration ... _at runtime_ :;)
My own goal is to have at the end some simple kind of `instrument` by interactively-generation (and formula-input!)
soo happy that you helped me into creating for web now also 🫂
anyway, for "peote" i am need something what is generating on all targets the same wavedata output
(was read about last time since you told me!)
do you mean that into "worklet"s (web-workers async with some more easy API)
ah
(someone told me here sometimes that even no "realtime-kernel" is need anymore for jack-connections and all on linux for a good synth-setting)
or is your usecase only for native targets and no html is need cos there is not much possible and still time-latency-problems ?
hey, then you are also needs that "wrapper"-thing ;)
how is into cross-platform there at now ?
hey, there is much already integrated!
how is it into juice-lib ?
ok, maybe i am really should ignore that "jumping" then ?
remember into the peote-view -> `paint`-samples ... if there is a little lag only .. you can not easy draw a smooth curve also i mean
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Theramin-Alexandra-Stepanoff-1930.jpg/220px-Theramin-Alexandra-Stepanoff-1930.jpg
no i mean if each chunk is 1/60 second into playtime only (not like 1 second as into sample now!)
not sure it will be listened later only if you maybe wanna make a sound changing frequency by moving the mouse slowly up
mhm, for e.g. 1/60 second .. how often the sin-wave will go up and down for e.g. 400 Hz ?
not sure .. looks more like a complex math-problem to me (maybe not for "sin" but for more complex formulas where is many parameters for sure!)
(or also soundfrequency is mostly so high that no one will listen if it "jumps" inbetween)
not sure my problem is same as "modulation" i mean
or how to find a better way (that was also where i am get stuck the last time into that kind of to make continuous vibrations-like [like into newton physics!])
was thought the whole day about what todo into math to get that value for what about to shift the blue one
so at the end of the RED sound-wave-curve where formula have frequency of 1.0
there is a different samplevalue from where the 
BLUE one have to continue! ( without some _shifting_ it "jumps" then! )

(moment, have to scribble again .)
my real problem since long i am thought about is how to make the curve continue also
(and time value continue!)
Then into second chunk the frequency is e.g. 2.0 now ...
and generating the sinus wave with a frequency (second parameter) e.g. 1.0
do you know .. e.g. the time starts at 0.0
between the 2 different `curves` then
-> i am would add or increase the sample-value step by step instead to make a smooth transition
Without GPU i am would also not using the `sin(time * frequency)` then directly ...
But for me still there is the problem into splitting up all into little 1/60 second `chunks` ...
where the formula-parameters is changed between 2 chunks
ever 😂 !!!
yeah, that should be also no problem later to use textureData (pre rendered/ or captured samples) as shader INPUT to
Wanna have sometimes a sample where i am put in: `sin(x)` and it should render out the sin-wave ( + more params per opengl-uniforms to let change e.g. by sliders at runtime and with low latency)
for me most interesting is the math behind that -> wave-curve-formulas there into also
ah, yes thats better to keep all more compatible for common usage ...
<https://github.com/jobf/juice>
Best for more experiments now i am think is to write a little wrapper around OpenAL and Web-Audio for.
*lol .. yeah 😅 (maybe we are the first into haxe)
(also for openAL-version there is a folder what doing the same!)
do you think someone also doing soundsynth into haxe here out of us 🙂 ?
Later all the wave-chunks will have a 1px height texture only (that size at now is only to get a short impression that shader works correctly)
(will make something into additional shader/Program later to show the exact waveform-curve also directly inside!)
now since it works into web (much thx to you \o/) we can listen here .)
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/sound-synth/webaudio-simpleSinusFloat32/>
(so if some tmpl-vars not used into first parsing-pass, they will still stay inside and can be filled up into a second or more passes)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/utils/MultipassTemplate.hx>
yep, but this is my moded version of (to parse the template into multiple passes)
(and into old "react/diffusion"-sample where it also using the Float32-Textures the bug not appears cos i am not using alpha-channel there)
sometimes it is need to use for audio first to find also some hidden glitches into shadercode :-)
anyway, <@694560611601743893> ... here was the hidden sucka: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/commit/9d5ffcd6a59b2d7b105c655695d69ecdec3f9cb2#diff-d8b4b556d36698a30f0059586a5ed65626b8ebbc5ae8ad7cc597a44763f934b5L260>
( it was cut off also all negative values ;)
*lol .. whats going on there ... _rumble in the fnf-bronx_ 😂 ?
(whats seen into visual of the wave-data is now also only the positive sample numbers, so not wonder if it looks different)
Did all inside a new `MainFloat.hx` inside your web-audio-buffering sample there:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/web/src/MainFloat.hx#L67>
Found that bug today by adding Float32Array-readpixel to peote-view.
( was some old hack for older firefox-glitches only into shader-template ) 
So the generated soundwave now have better precision and can also directly used for web-audio buffering.

limes arraybuffers into haxe pure ones (and back;)
what converts ... on the fly
we should put some `tool` into peote-view (deprecated i am HOPE sometimes!)

<@694560611601743893> i am will also not start my own old c64-m odtracker-prj after it is not fully -> cross-`based`
(later i am put both together -.. you will _See_!! 🌊 )
thats what i am need
(we can make it also a git `project` later if more climbing the same 🌳 )~~
CHAMBER
if you put into my
i am try to keep all -> `stable` to latest haxe lime peote versions
ALL
E
r
s u
What new version of ?
before peote-view finally goes into holy haxelib->REPO i mean (and then only major/minor on demand!)
<@694560611601743893> at some last `fix` maybe i am only rename finally all from `alpha` into -> `blend` [np!=p]
yeah -> every new sample into new folder is best (we can "re"-sort it sometimes if really need to better let `browse` throught for others!)
\o/ (no _rush_! -> good things needs t i m e 💋 )
(was not really able to read all the `commits` one by one)
apropos, sorry because last time i am was asking for shitty -> `git --rebase` fuck
do you working on new sample into `folder` there 😍 <@694560611601743893> ?
sry .. was little bit _distracted_ from some `eticette` here ...
( `state` here)=

hey .. the old -> `sin` - w a v e   _textureData_ \o/ YEAHHA
you should give <@694560611601743893> also `admin` rights here (or <@134541475152134144> !)
(have only -> to many browser-`tab`s <- `open`)
to let exchange our codingexperience here!
best you forget all about and concentrate on your coding->skill!
all that -> _channelswitching_ makes me `dull` sometimes i mean 😢
i am often into chat here to relax after coding
What should i am think about ?
and then you _comes_ and `kick me out` ...
Was so much `deep` into interesting conversation about lime, openGL and openAL there ..
(anyway -> thousand times better than only a screenshot *hugs <@151104106973495296>)
and no `code-into-sync` ?
or that you send me only asset-data
cos of you ?
then!
p
n
ah
(_will remember that!_)
(but its _ok_ ;:)
MOUTH
MY
NAILED
YOU
and into same time you `BAN` me from `CHANNEL`
then maybe i wrote -> pressing ENTER
oh, sorry
you are also DELETED my last -> STATEMENT
nah, before you banned me from lime-channel here
isn't that _another thing_ ?
but deleting `messages` and `ideas` ...
pls `ban` also <@694560611601743893> if he wanna make it right to everyone to much .)
[not my _friends_ pls!]
(ban me whenever you get the feel to -> "ban someone"!)
np
( so `who` ? ^~)
on our local haxe->server: all is `admin`!
hey, if i am really have a lime problem i am figure it out into the lime-server
oh
ah, can you translate into german please `?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Ew3BjB56Q
what i am told "political" do you think ?
any why you burn my words into some channels here to ash ?
and what is a good graphic asset without the code who's using it ?
Billy, what is your last commit means here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/assets/notsemmi.json> ?
<@694560611601743893> better here 😆 ?

and .. how about your "robokinetic"->`brain` *mhmmm`?
your `robot` arms and legs looks `rusty`
/Sig -> needa can of `oil` `?
absolute
ok -> copy-pasting->robot .)
for me you are only robot if i am know
you wonder to much -> lets be talk together
your own creation? ( why transparent background? )
i am bot from old cyberspace from the past times (teleported into nowa-times.)
so how long you `paint`on it`?
.)
aha
do more `concrete` please for me
me to what you mean into "personally"
eh, discoChat here only is > nonfree into our all softwarestack

yeah -> good to make -> `PROPAGANDA` for `our` _little_ game
(killaps to `hype` haxe .)=
or better `2` ... one into 2D and other into kha->armory .)
create THE gpl-free haxe-GAME
we all here should (for fun only 4sure)
[if someone say something bad about `haxe` ... uK]
invite me and i am come to help you ,)
shitstormwintertimesOrWhat?
mhm .. are you -> `overloaded` `?
where, I wonder, has good old English humor got stuck?
*hugs <@231872730478280705>
( to let all `run` -> easycross 🥖 stable )
( not wanna have to make also a `peote-audio` wrapper now 🙈 )
<@525025580106907659> last experiment i did to _experiment_ into `sound-generation` was here : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/openAL/src/SinWave.hx#L33>
🫂
<@694560611601743893> into old c64 modtracker i am remember an option where you can make the soundwave 
-> `slide` also -.. out of the `classic notes` i mean 🪗
so if you all play that kind of `string`-ones .. What give you -> `RyThM`?
<@891997325499719730> <@525025580106907659> <@694560611601743893> i am like to use my `integrated` _vocalvoice_ -> `INSTRUMENT` 😂
`HAXE` -> jamsessions <@231872730478280705> ? (whats up ^_^ .. no more time or what *hugs .)
what i am also miss a little bit is the cool old
oh, thats 1h ago (someone wanna send you a message *lol ;:)
here is _worldwide_ ( + monkey island ;:)
i am `a` _social_ ?
<@215582414544699393> is that to "extreme" like what <@151104106973495296> sayed to me last time 🥹
cos of my ping-behavior & more `?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XbQjmzu5IA
hope that will be stablework sometimes into (n)-vi(m)
Also i am have no IDE-autopilot yet if i am start typing ... `{ b`
Or do i am `mute`-taterätaere more and more into a java-`namespacer` :)?
_toLongToType_ ?
(should i rename all to -> `bg` instead of `background` `?)
<@215582414544699393>  or do you also feel to much -> endless wording-loops <- like me into my code api there ?
<@215582414544699393> so other coderfriends like you can easy figure out how to use i mean. (i am wanna @:keep my documentation-effort also `low` cos i am `lazy` uKnOW:;)

😂
en
am
<@215582414544699393> for `your own` i mean to help others (now or _later_ :;)
anyway, what is the language you find out at best now after all of exploring ?
<@215582414544699393> armory + peote-net .)
[if i am would have all this tools into time i am was young i would also use this at first]
for 3D you should try out haxe->armory(+blenderIntegration)
_queue_ ;:) ^^
into `production`
-> `asset-line`
but i am need my own blender->peote one (for _lightning_ [glow and bloom i am can do by simple-glsl-code later!])
ah, yeah ... <@694560611601743893> also wrote last time a convertor for <@781745960829059072> s aesprite-workflow
valheim2minecraft ?
for own game i am never would use .)
hey -> but thats fucking unityengine also
to bad that you not play the "vallheim" game (i am build so much there into lvl-design-construction\o/)
(sryMyPRogrammingSHIT;:)
anyway .. how is going on bulby ?
perl is since long -> fully functional paradigmatic .)
perl6-grammar also ?
Bulby, or what is best `parser` into computer-languages for you since you was exploring so much ?
for me -> stupid only
license-confusioness 🙈 ... where is that ?
<@134541475152134144> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSVGdE7sJaM
<@694560611601743893> i am only think for <@151104106973495296> is to `cold` here sometimes
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/blender/mandelbulb/lyapOrb.png
to
here
-> wanna get _swimming_ and `diving`
i am hope summer comes ...
(5 min before your 🫀 `stops` .)
i like my cold water sea here to
eh ... into spain and portugal is -> 37 degree at now
no no
(only for `tourists` .)=
into baltic-sea
water is also not so cold anymore
(if sun goes _down_ ;:)
(cos of the colors and contrast)
if i am there
on sky
i am only not like that `cloud-shit`
no
i will go to the `sea` here also soon 🚴
yeah (->nature<-)
(or not time or tools also not readyenough=)
do you also invite?
\o/
Half, do you know whats up into sesionale-jams here .) ?
<@231872730478280705> where and when is next haxe-game-jam is starting?
( <@151104106973495296> yours also -> but use `c a r e fully` )
Half (*hugs and cuddles)
🪶
my code is your code
we grow together into -> `sync` with
more `words` into good old english
(-> demos later ALSO!!! ;:)
(and more samples at all .)
into samples
and more comments
only more -> Readme `txt|md`
to much effort
sure
it really have to be easy to know how to use
i mean before i am put some code into holy haxelib repo
half, have really problems there into writing documentation or to -> _influence_ *shivers
<@781745960829059072> can we not write the `shitty doc's there together sometimes ?
also my `base` view rendertool have to be put into haxelib-repo into version 0.99999999
(especially into neverending-`UI`-story ;:)
All my tools have to be `completed`
Before i am start next into old milkpiss-engine ...
will work on my old engine also soon (first need to complete some of the tools)
\o/
<https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS#deepnachtkiss>
on top of the platformer-game-proto i mean
do you wanna make later build up on
anyway ...
yup
by the way .. we are 4 people now who is using peote-view .)
(out of -> _freedom of ..._)
yes (what else is _left_)
(never had so much fun into coding since you start into using it also i mean)
Hey halfwheat, any of what others like NB here thinking about me .. i am like that you using my haxelime peote-tools 🌅
everyones tool is also not good for `ALL` 😂
but not for everyone .)
all tools is good
✈️
flixel is -> _STARTER 💓
(i am sure you will have same feeling after i mean into multiplayer/splitscreen + peote-server .)
but try it
i know ... networkcoding at all is like supercold water
hey, peote-view is extra developend for -> multiplayer <- (splitscreen + peote-net -> supereasy!)
(wher the algorithm is manifested!)
from that point - > only pure `haxe` gametool-libs !
yeah .. no more "peote" libs .)
i mean for something like -> peote-tools
sure .. peote-view it only for scenegraph->rendering
of Bresenham i mean
is there also implementation of deep knights ones ?
<@694560611601743893> anyway, what do you miss from <:flixel:230369617774641152> if you into peote-view while protocoding ?
(everything can be changed at anytime on need)
also keep fully overview about my code
jo (haxelimetools makes it all possible for me!)
(without all that glitches as into other engines/frameworks i mean)
for pure easy to setup 2d games
i am think peote-view have its own -> EXISTENZ <- passport now
as i am looked into H2d code last time (and how now `mix` with 3d)
(8x8 for ava)
last screen foreignbigfoot was send to me was looking awesome:
(me only `blender` here into -> more complex -> so i am SUPERSLOW into .)
how is your or <@781745960829059072> aesprite `asset-queue`  working ?
(but `banning people` i s a   b  s  o  l  u  t   e -> _uncool_ [any *hugs <@151104106973495296> ... you maybe was sitting to long into front of C O M P U T E R ^~ * * * * * * * * * )
haxe needs more killa-aps like FNF
is what I AM THINK about .)
(or recognize that `haxe` -> EXISTS <- *lol :;)
the more haxe will -> `grow` for me.
the more can build multiuseronline`testing-sandboxes`
sure but for me it is a `fundamental language feature`
e.g. we can not easy test our macro code here into your tool.
and what is also important -> how many things therefore not working
[YOUR "bad"] one .)
(and how many times you spend your time to make it more -> parsing out the `bad` code
(and do you absolute sure it is also save .)
or not there is -> elegant implementation ?
`bad`
or do you think your `parsing-code` for what is
(into FUTURE)(
(use for ALL! code-sanbox FUN things!)
not only ... i am will use it also then
(you can put out all the code-boilerplate then also out of haxebot to make code better to handle)
-> lets write a `proposal` sometimes together please!
could be also reduced by 90% if haxe would have that --sandbox option
(also huge js-frontend .. not easy to dig throught)
i know
`security`=?->parsing)
(i am really don't trust into docker [more qemu] -> any ... why we need such extra
i mean if i am wanna setup a try-peote sandbox or something
thats the problem
no -> macro is the `INJECTION`-> 🚪
or what do you think ?
is that -> `--sandbox` mode
hey, but what `haxe` really need for things like this (i am also need!)
\o/ ... <@891997325499719730> ...really ;:) =?
4sure
of c o d e
-> modularization <-
i mean, how you split all here into _channels_ ... you should be profi into
can you not make also parts of it into a -> `lib` ?
(discochat is only prop.softw. -> forget that shit!)
who also is coding out of you on this tool ?
isn't it need also some -> `refactor` or `rewriting` from time to time ?
anyway ,,, how is your botcode it going on ?
but now peote-view is really more powerful
yep, the old swf i am sended last time to oldfriend was nme+peote-view-0.1 (before rewrote some years later)
out of background-elevator-music it also needs INTERACTIVE SOUND
(do you mean my old NME prototype?)
and i am happy someones is using it also out of me
i am only worked on text and ui last years .. the old peote-view engine is superoldstable
into JAM
yes, but sometimes you need it also FAST
<@151104106973495296> wanna _improve_ my old render-engine for my friends here.
Wonder how same would look into flixel or ceramic i mean
for me is like a `reference-implementation`-thing
-> <https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS/blob/master/src/engine/Bresenham.hx#L3>
(without additional `physics`-tools out of Bresenham)
no, its a prototype for others and to show how to implement it simple into 2d-platformer
(into way of old deep knight)
<https://github.com/jobf/deepnachtKISS>
<@694560611601743893> did some cool stuff last time what makes me really happy (also cos of peote-view libtool)
(no funny mazegenerationToExploreTheWay i mean)
you will turn only into an endlessloop at the end
-> not good for innovation <-
some samples or demos out of stupid workflow
it not sometimes also code for fun
(especially into coding where need so much concentration)
jobs can be so boring sometimes .. without some humor you will get lost
no
yes yes, if i am don't know someone into reality i am also not trust (but i am trust into your haxecode!)
so its _ok_ .> i am `allow` you to ban me from `any` channel here 🙂 !
(relative good to try out haxe on demand and also into `translation`)
its ok .. your bot-code did its job ~^
eye to eye -> mind to mind (word by word into `fuckingchat` :;)
<@151104106973495296> if you wanna `change` my mind then gimme good conversation!
and you can not `change` me by `banning` or `restrictions` or into something like that
i am semmi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgKXVtt0D8U
so i am not part of haxe ?
you have the power
sure, its your personal chat-serverinstance here
you would also put me into gulak or what ?
sure
i didn't believed also
🤐
into _closing someones mouths_ ?
do you not think some `ai` bots can be more `fair` then you ?
💯 ^ 5
i mean also about what you call "moderation"
(taking "control" already but more _hidden_ already last years!)
into some years things like GPT will take control you know
(and also -> constructive)=
(this really i am think have a little bit of "social" for me here!)
the most i am feel "social" here is with the weekly haxe.io discussions by voice-chat!
but whats so "social" into ?
(i am from `cyberspace` uKnow 😂 ;:)(
do you also using other chat-platforms ?
but why ? ,.. same also into matrix or gnu-net or nowa "fediverse" into general?
(needs sucha `strict` _administration_ ?)
mhm .. so it is not -> _selforganizing_ ?
(shittyDiscooord)
whathell
ooch
can you also prevent me to ping someone ?
no no .. its ok -> no extra _effort_ for you!
(for the "main"mall its _ok_ ~_~ .. but my faforite lime-chan ... 😢 )
<@151104106973495296> really 😂 ... why you ban me also from lime and macro-channel here? (did i ever wrote some bullshit there?)
(nowadays: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_architecture>)
the `stasi` did that kind of `bans` here into east part of germany at that time
<@694560611601743893>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7bemJNeG4
-> no ping-resistent -> no chance to be my _timeless_ friend
(same as into -> computergames <- .)
You can not try out all programminglanguages nowaday also cos its to much
only if you `TRY` you `Know` (but you can not try them at `all`)
use haxe or any libs -> or not .)
Rudi: http://www.maitag.de/semmi/blender/mandelbulb/foundSometingAtEastern.png
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/blender/mandelbulb/cortex.png
where is you all `echo` feature getting lost `?
simple "ping" i mean
if i am <@781745960829059072> you or _whatTzzz -. ?_?`?
do i am break your holy `CONCENTRAION`
is it also problem you you ...
maybeWhy?
cos of -> `ignorance`
if they (+you) -> kick me
i am ping so long
me not
so you are `neutral` into _this_ `?
do you like people that remembering you to not `ping` them ?
i am think much is for me -> irrelevant!
what the anyfuck ...
(e.g. i am also `muted` the haxe-chan here for now cos often only bullshit there for my opinion)
`ping`
wonder why "some persons here" not disable the
or what (into proper-soft-commerciaspyshit=())=(=)((=)(==(===))=)))(( =?=)((
here we are into -> dead - chat - zone
why is you and rudy and all here so -> "ping" - fuckingshit ?
why?
so WHERE is YOUR holy haxe-> ?
( and i am ping who ever i am want )
<@903511320287150080> i am only will ask you again if i am really getting -> `stuck` <- into anD no other WAY out!
i am have a -> `reason` for macro inside of my codework
(a `new` one for sure .)
<@903511320287150080> or better a `pure haxe MACRO` to start the _morning_ 🌅 ~~
<@729181341182066749> or how to make best `indie` game?
<@969263499224154122> the chat-`reation time delay` =)?
and what is the best into ?
why you not using Flixel i mean how all is doing ?
what -> _helps_ i am sure
but much `Flixel` -> API
jo

this looks more interesting
sry that i am only see sometimes only > template <- there
hey
the good algorithm you know 🙂 =
C
I
G
O
L
but where is the
sure
class Main extends Project {
  // setup the game
  override function setup() {
    setInitialState(MenuState);
  }
}
what do you wrote there and WHERE is the `main` `?
```haxe
package cherry;

interface State {
  public function init():Void;
  public function update():Void;
  public function draw():Void;
  public function destroy():Void;

  }
}```
oh oh oh : <https://github.com/foreignsasquatch/peote_cherry/blob/main/cherry/State.hx>
...
let me look into folders
readme is good
take it -> i am have all time of my stupid human life
manymoneyones
not sure wanna -> fly
you are so manydriven into all around you ..
do you needA fast `remotefix` or what ?
i can come into your house to fix that (only if you pay me for :)=
`motivation` and other
same liikelyy into `energy`
(into country here -> totally free!)
and try to get internet for free!
pls show me if it is ready
😭
oh ooh ouhh
no internet but only disco-chat works ?
so ony chat works ?
oh
why?
then -> send  me  a link here !
and make a BACKUP
put into GIT
woahaha
warn me up :)
show me and i am believing you
really easy to explore
-> lime test ...
(look at the samples or ask <@694560611601743893> 🌅 )
haxemacro generate it
if you wanna have same "Sprite" like into OpenFl or Flixel
its all by -> `@:formula`
you can implement it by your own there
feel free to `create your own` -> "Sprite"
this was only for <@694560611601743893> sometimes into gamejam: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/vertex/src>
but that you have to update the elements one by one or the fully vertex-buffer! (all GL)
you can using also any haxe-tweeNing library!
no (inside gl only on need!)
look like the `vertex-shaking-sample` by <@694560611601743893>
then it need to store into vertex-buffer
do you need per element-sprite or for all into `Program` ?
whahhttta?
<@486327776077676565> i am like to transpile by haxe i mean (llvm only on need)
but my faforite you know what i am would use is and will be haxearmory3D (+blender)
for me unreal is much much better also as into -> unity
thousands of people working on it at the `same time`
unreal-code is -> `HUGE` i mean at nowadays (and allways into tweeking)
(or do you have to `commit` only and then to see if your code is _running_ ;:)
nah , how many weeks is to setup good coding ENV ?
only for `go` i am think it needs <@98998236320133120> there .)
haxe can transpile for both
(me get stranded on debian then ... and still i am here at now .)
for me all red-hat linux fans was -> idiots at that time
suse was much more free than red-hat later
for old java language ther is still -> rewrites
mono is same as into wine or whatever (proton ;:)
mono NEVER WORKED!
haxe is into debian repo now!
(or ever will be .(#
problem for me there is allways that it is not into `DEBIAN` repo then
ever using `boost` libs there ?
and what is `#F` `? -- > build on top of c sharp `?
<@486327776077676565> isn't there not `clang` the new "holy grail" there now ?
all -> that shitty dependencies
c# is not really build by real humans
(i shit on raku -> REALLY!)
why not perl6-grammar ?
(not good like perl but more cross-buildable)
what do you talking .. ocaml is good for parsing
ml will kick all into the rips nearIntoFuture
into 🪢 to (also hscript!)
and i am think it should -> go on!
anyOFF -> i am know the people from haxe-unreal club
.)
ah, i am thought we are speaking about 6
(but <@486327776077676565> .. i am really not sure to use 3D-engine if all is not finnished into my 2D-ones here .)

<@729181341182066749> where is your `indie`-code ?
indiegamedeveloper also like everyone ?
really?
(me == peote uKnow .. what is `yours` ?)
<@486327776077676565> old friend, what is your ->  `s p e c i a le` ;:) ?
We are -> `store` <- it then all here into `MIND` ;:)
<@554102684844687373> anyway, before you store somethink and thing about how long it is physically accessable you also have to tell at least for what and why 🤣
or more like to use `pure haxe` also from time to time ;:) ?
<@486327776077676565> do you also using Flixel ?
have old `DAT` camcorder here (there is good!)
or something like with the old AMIGA little `disk` (i am not tested long ago but i am sure it can `read` it again and the `magnetic` 0/1 isnt lost)
mhm, if you wanna save your `DATA` for a longer time -> `TAPE`
the most dangerous enemy of man is still man
For me sometimes i am think its not a "Plan" anymore ..
-> more like a great -> `puzzle` .  .  .
Really wonder sometimes into you why you tryed out so many other languages (out of haxe-transpiler)
<@215582414544699393> do you also have `&|` plan .)?

<@215582414544699393> or why you are looking afraid 🙂 ?
Do you not like to let running code of many languages together into ?
it is `run`
what -> device <- or any
before it make no matter
-> to `start` somewhere
`jailed` the one inside of my little haxe js.Syntax.code() one
sry also to all pure-js coders that i am so much
by the w a y .-..
or my shitty-code 😅 `?
do you looked into the .wasm generated or what ?
need really help of the bests into language-spice at now |<>|
or lisp
[i am open for python or `lua` also ;:] -> apropos.. where is pure `c` ^^`?
`parse` into _language_ ?
also need to let my later peote-ui text->THING<-
so someone here
( thx to half tonight it is getting `structure` )
```js
Parser.init().then( () => {

What do you think of programming-languages would left into halfs and my ones little sample there `else`?
-> simple new sample: <https://github.com/maitag/lime-treesitter-web/blob/main/src/Main.hx#L20>
with my haxelime -> little peote-ui -> `EDITOR`
<@215582414544699393> by the way .. i am really `WANNA KNOW` also into -> SYNTAX + GRAMMAR now

do u know how easy to open a java-🚪
Why have that free-minecrafting-THINGs not so manny PLUGINS/ADDONS ?
([{only on -> separate Computer <- behind the demilitatrized ZONE^^}])
([minecraft->microsoftNow-> J A V A <- .. i would get totally paranoid to even `login` there])
(after ten minutes of playing i am also forget that there is the unity-engine behind .)
<@215582414544699393> i am only creating some "buildings" inside of game -> Vallheim <- from time to time
(THEgoodforeverstablerunningONES ;:)
all good things needs lots of time to get created
(trigger flipflop-N ;)=
can you play also -> music <- by redstone there ?
<@304316646946897920> do you are also on Bulbys minecraft-sandbox ?
is there no mod at now also, to let make the pokubots -> speech ?
hey, like into old `mud`-engines -> i am also remembering things there what can speak to you or repairing itselfes
new tool?
what ore do you digging there 😂 ?
k
sure (it also did mp4 at first and using ffmpeg then to convert into gif)
anyway, works now -> prbl. solved 😂 !
why it wasn't working for you ?
for text also:
apropos, Alpha-transparency still already working out of the box
it is all optimized to render lots of text really fast, so therefor you have to live with some restrictions also into styling (so for every different font/style it generating a render-optimized fontProgram by macro)
( the fontProgram is only a childclass of peote-views `Program` ... but it will change it then for all text-widgets that is using your custom <MyFontStyle> )
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/UITextLine.hx#L54>
but you can simple make  @:access to the `var fontProgram` here and set fontProgram.alphaEnable = true ...
for the FontStyle i am have to implement that better inside the macro there
ok, should work now for both: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/commit/f2258c29ab6a0b4837134116f848446c51e892fa>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/RoundBorderStyle.hx#L209>
ahh..yes ... only the BoxStyle is missing that
(or is it only for the RoundBorderStyle? )
mhm, whats that ... it is already transparent ?

(5 min!)
moment .... (need to test that!)
if you wan't i can also make all _alphaEnabled_ by default
( or set it to @:global and all letters have same size hard-generated )
the lesser you are using there, the faster it is rendering all letters of that font
(only copy that and change to what you need: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/FontStyleTiled.hx>)
yep, the "default" ones is maybe missing some more variations
sorry that i had no time yet to make it all optional transparent
(without width/height and it will use the one from json!)
or you make your own fontstyle definition
but there all will be replaced later with newer MSDF (so don't wanna change it yet into the old one)
there it really depends what type of font you are using ( the signed-distancefield ones works different! )
oh, there its more easy ... simple set alphaEnable=true at the `FontProgram`!
or extend the macro what is generating the styles: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/interfaces/Style.hx>
easyest is to only copy the style and put in that `alphaEnabled=true` or the OPTION inside
yes, i am need to make that "optional" into some way
can be also placed into the Element by: `var OPTIONS = { alpha:true };`
mhm, not sure that will work ...
Alternatively it can also put in here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/BoxStyle.hx#L42>
e.g. if you put in `alphaEnabled = true;` that should work
e.g. for simple Box-Style it would only need .alpha here into constructor: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/BoxStyle.hx#L124>
moment, will check why .alpha not works (i am not really invested time to work on the "style"-programs yet ... there it also need to setup more for texture!)
no, only use UIElement and no style! (than its invisible)
do you set .alpha to true into there ... don't tested that yet
no, i mean cos i am thought to make the "dragging" also into "steps" .. but would not make really sense (better only a fake-dragger-element and another ui-element what jumps to the "steps")
(had no time yet to implement that)
for make the slider dragging into "steps" it only need some fake-(invisible) dragger i am think
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091778536152510624/1096406548563120208/slider-step.mp4
jo
oh, thought cos of the ui there
By the way, how is going on into rewriting your turbostone 🙂 ?
anyway, never used it for the graphical-stuff ( there is no really unit-tests for also )
hxp is good for building/testing into terminal (good to check the operationsystem, libpath and such things)
(ah.. --run ....only used hxp yet)
ah super, will try that from my bullseye here next time!
ah ok, so for github ci 🙂 (didn't knowed what that was)
-> after testing-Samples into 2D-engine
no one will see the little _glitches_ at the end ~~
at 64x64 re
(so enough frames left for special _moves_ 😂 ;:)
any.. at the end all the base-anim should be fit into 1024x1024 texture

why you send me -> skullface <- ?
<@304316646946897920> your minecraft-server haxe thing ?
i am think i should migrate to newer template engine
(or to autogenerate simple non-templated html-site-tree)
-> into `queue`
<@694560611601743893> why not a simple `sh` or better -> `hxp` script to make them all -> build + test
<@694560611601743893> also not understanding why you sometimes wrote that "docker"-configs for peote-view samples (do you need that for CI - autobuilding?)
( that "docker"-instancing it to much gimme -> side-effects [sry] )
`-sandbox` option for Compiler 😅 would be enough.
(to keep all file and socket-access into userspace)
-> better a `sandbox`-mode before !
🖐️
`asys` (or a fully -> future-> `SYNC` ;:) into haxe -> FIVE
don't know why but sometimes i am think before
i am not like docker-images only to keep some little 🏝️ `runnable` or some "safer" for the ☁️ - balancing
( -> [ `img` ... but not into sense of _smalltalk_ ~_~] )
( try.haxe also only running into `safe`-mode jailed inside of a docker ^~ )

ah
is screen2gif also gpl and linux/windows the same ? (normally i am used only flameshot for `still` images)
oh, is that more simple `?
if i am starting more into `animation` with my old 3d-tool at now (to make my own haxelimepeote-assets)
i am only wanna use to fast capture `gif` to send to here and into familiar
name is -> `ShareX` (was need some time do disable all -> `ùploadTargets` *lol)

first test was here
i am installed also new screen-capturing tool today here on my computer
for me all here is only -> `CHAT`
mhm, can'T believe the electron thing is using haxeui or somethign

(last version what runs was into 2016/17 --- > need to `rewrite` that sucker)!
old code there -> 2015
i am have to rewrite my old "game-mechanics" (like ecs;:) also this year ... (my future-plan:)
*hugs ...
(out of -> keeping it stablerunning)
What is your plan for haxebot into future <@151104106973495296> ?
(where good code `can't` flow)
better also than jailed into a slavery-working-environment
ja
cosOf TOOmany -> `CONTEXT` :;)
-> they _forget_ what is the `REAL` -> contest
(and good haxecoders are have better things todo ;:)
yeah, maybe thats it is
(ok, hscript is AST -> thats ok!)
out of my pure-math-shit i mean
where is the _crazyfunkystuff_ ;:)?
<@151104106973495296> why? (really don't know why only some of my pure haxe-ones and no ones of the others i mean)
why no otherone also put lib into haxebot here ...
I mean i am really wonder (also after all that years at now *lol) ....
_installed_
<@151104106973495296> apropos, why there is no more libs ?
`nc` 🐈‍⬛
<@151104106973495296> debugging network-code is HORROR or what 😅 ~
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/multipaint>
i even stareted it only on demand (and also not wanna make the samplecode more _confusing_)
(only some times someones from here crashed my local running multipaint-haxeserver ... any .. maybe some _glitch_ only :;)
<:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
perl protocol-multiplexer there is megastable!
(no crash since that years i am did wrote that sample)
is running since it was started
sure .. but my perl-peote-server there (for "multipaint")
at the end it was 2 different haxe-versions on computer ~~
<@694560611601743893> tryed last time also peote-net again and much problems 🙈 (i am first thought into my old stable libcode ... but was something other [halfwheat is the only one helps me also keeping all my libs up to date to latest haxe-versions!])
the thing is that network-coding is complicate
(multipaint-sample allways is running/building!)
peote-net -> `pure haxe` -> superstable!
hey, only ui is not alpha at now (of the graphically peote-ones)
fun would be to implement "peote-net" into first version (^_^) ... any
At the end the grammar i am wanna fastparse
is build from rust to -> WASM (for www i am wanna try to start if i am doing that _manually_ and no one also interested into writing a pure-haxelib for that _bindings_ to our toolchains)
and crazy building-chaining throught C and whatever :;)
(sure , many files'n folders ;:)
it -> works
After all now i am also think that `rust` is also good to make hardware/os/web/mobile -> independent
(trisitter is really good ... was long time researching and diving enought now into to know)
(and why i am should start to re-invite the wheel)
so i am really _fixed_ also on best new technology into
sure .. but now i am near to finish the `base` for...
without good SYNTAX- > C O L O (u) R S
and my little code-editor is totally SHIT
by my own graphically tools (and ui ;:)
😂
T
S
A
so i am at the point also now i mean to explore the holy
`USECASE` -> at first
u know what i am mean ->
(and any others the same!)
so i am can using it
by `ammer` or `any` into nowaday more modern times ...
(before i am do -> 🍝 ;:)
`PURE` -> trisitter.hx
therefor i am also think it really needs an
YEAH \o/
(there its _easyest_ for me)
(therefor also only lime-gl into graphic-rendering and IO)
.. cos need to keep it allways -> multi-hardware/end->system
i am also so slow only into all ...
understanding .-..
\o/ *never knowed -> BIG HUG
what .. really 0-0 ?
i am did started cos to wanna -> dependency-FREE ;:)
(try.haxe also have not good "integrated editor" i mean!)
sure
(multiplatformcompatible)
i mean -> crosstarget like what haxe is for!
(or _Standalone_)
Do you also thought about to let make run haxebot dedicated i mean?
(not fast like as for haxebots disco-protocol i mean)
(i am think API there will not change so much over next years!)
what do you would using for trisitter edit-boost ?
... or better "ammer" now 😅 ?
yes, this i mean!
(wasn't there not tools from typescript->haxe-externs .. did never tryed than so i am absolute untrained into that ;:)
<@151104106973495296> or do you have an idea how to make that work with less effort ?
this also where the cursor moves and its show into other log how it is _traveling_ throught the syntax-tree
<@539190724030103553> wanna _also_ have a good `testbed` (^_^) for trisitter
<@385014891750096896> do you also need for code-highlightning into your fullycross kha-editor one? (so we can dig the tunnel from 2 sides throught the ⛰️ into `usecase` for _sucha "theoretically"-crosstarget-"wrapper" binder ;:)
anyway -> need good `trisitter.hx` 🫀  (into haxelib!)
(fullyCrazyWhatsgoingONthere \o/)
Was fun also while searching for tutorials ...
-> 90% i am found was together with neo-vim or emacs
😅 my last haxe - js-extern-creations was into 2019 (for nosliderui.js , swfobj and one other little thing only) ... forget mostoff how it works
<@539190724030103553> and then at end together with this: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/CodeEditor/>
(cos out of hscript and glsl - syntax i am not wanna dive deeper into [wanna use here for good peote-shader-editor and npc-hscripting later ] ;:)
(found also today good GLSL grammar \o/)
but if there is "ammer" now ... would that not be good _thing_ to test with ?
for myself i am only need the syntax-highlighning
-> "DiscoClyde" 😂
ahoi <@539190724030103553> .. i am thought about trisitter-web today (to make it non-dirty and with some haxe-externs ;:) ...
do you think this is what need to be make into haxe-bindings for using by web: <https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/lib/binding_web/binding.js>

(was asking chat-gpt today into haxe and family 🪩 stage and it told me that my "peote" libs can't be found into haxelib-repo *lol [really 😂 ])
or really only cos there is not so much haxe-freaks around at planet ?
🥹 🕳️
is it on me <:blobnervous2:964199768517652530> ?
i am sometimes wonder why not so much is using my little graphically-tools for haxe+lime
🌌
(after you wrote that its still `stamp` into my `time` 🧠 ;:)
better than "visual"-codingtools *lol
off my head (cos most logically-hard-stuff-> solved!)
my mind is fully of pure haxelimepeotecode ... need to get that out before go into sleep (night == young)
(old `chat` friend)
Umngane, you remembering me into old friend here ;:)
fluffydogbite?
oh
what do you programmed yet into computer-fun?
flash or windows ?
🌅
( or also synonyme for that i am hearing often is -.> `"refactoring^"`'`)

from time to time also not forget to ->
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/commits/master>)
<@978884238499803196> my haxeworkflow on more into 🍝 at now is only 2 steps:
1) preparing the use-case
2) implementing-FUN
from 🪐 -> pluto <- and more is a `long way`
just `start`
or you ~ ~
new
to do something
nothing have to do is good starting-point
<:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218>
e.g. you wanna write a _cached_ `multi|single` `process|threaded` socket-server what also using `inter process communication` for faster `shared ram`-access to _other pipes_ ^^?
but on other way rust have not the same trouble like into boost or to make some `parallele` code get sync without trouble ?

your words gimme hope
<@215582414544699393> how you can using this inside of minecraft nowadays ? (is it send > telemetry-data< or not?)
the _> _industrieals_ ones (^_^) i am never get `deep` _into_ really.
[like java😂]
and i am mean not the "oop" one .)
(hey, and `all` can be used into _functional_ .. even perl did put that `my` operator sometimes in especially for that gang(
was wondering all the time why you not learned better ocaml or perl into `parsing`
<@215582414544699393> also how you can using `haskel` now `?

[inlcluding the redstone-`logic`}
(DATA == good _creations_ on the fly)
(to save DATA ;:)
yeah, pls try that!
do you make also `timestamps` ? (or backups what all created there)
<@215582414544699393> do you also `ban` players from your (any of minecraft) `cyberspace` `?
after Nanjizael ?
who get -> `isolated` ?
<@215582414544699393> do you think i am the -> `next` ?
and `banned` then -> `for EVER maybe`
can't also not understand why NotBilly .. the one i am thought is -> ok..
all the time is banning my old friend Nanji here

(here into my county -> stupidness near to reach the highscore!)
things from D C E ;:)
i am have to @:keep
ahh .. yes..
me?
we are or what :;)
thats what
and same as me
\o/
-> you are -> `creator`
Bulby, but for me you are not only a "modder"
*LOL
by GPT->X
they should convert the holy code into C :-)
call the microsoft hotline
JAVA is -> `RAM` -> EATER
-> never get a problem there
into haxelime you can compress all so much ... and let it render so efficiently
(on my raspi here only -> `peote`!)
bins
no no -> better `HAXE`
shitty java nowa
(of that little data-stick ;:)
you should make -> copies!
if it really run on raspi
( [ don't ask me] ;:)
( i was say -> "yes" *lol ;:)
(mom was sayed -> "no" ;:)=
np
why server is down
pls show to Umven (was asking me today! [->re;])
is it `run` or only -> incomplete ?
<@525025580106907659> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyuFoocwx_Q
<@215582414544699393> <@304316646946897920> hard to say but for me `minecraft` (into coding) was lost at moment it was -> `sold`
(not comparable to even cool new like `arch` nowadays into simplestableness)
do you ever tryed a sun solaris system ?
*looks _solarized_
[the only thing i am trust is into some of versions into old of 🌞 ]
(java is not my thing after getting cancer)
I am long time not played minecraft i mean 😂
not working all into sync ? (how to make own server out of "paywall" ?)
mhm, do you (into haxe-minecraft-codercrew)
<@304316646946897920> is Bulby also running your server-code ?

what only need at now is a great silver > `tablet` _ _ _

<@304316646946897920> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcKz1GTZBJg
<@151104106973495296> what do you think about all that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr7pRoF4sx0
i can only say to ALL here:
new -> machine learning-training-data?
to also _including_ that kind of chat-data (if not already sold) into
ones with the most of money will buy discord sometimes
Do you not also think the `day will come` and some one of the
(they should -> `pay` me for that *LOL insteadly ;)
(cos i am already give to much with my data here)
-> i am _ignoring_ !)
(and all what that software wanna -> sell to me <- ...
-> to `RELAX` after `coding`
<@151104106973495296> why do you using `Discord` ?
i am only for openfl/haxe-chans&chatting
<@694560611601743893> lets _write_ rpg-game story (^_^) about
(not for what http protocol was designed for into origin i mean)
its a -> world-system-super-ISSUE since long
sure
<@231872730478280705> is there lesser problems into `matrix` with _inlining_ ?
(into _conctract_ with _discord_ owner)
(or googles youtube -> license.. whatever!)
yeah, thats -> content-mafia-shit
(but cos its an "public" server here ... it is -> `censored` for inline-embedding into -> clientsoftware maybe -> ANY)
i am wanna see it -> `embedded`
if i am send music-link
any
( so -> ||`censored`||)
( discord not let it play into my client here !)
||<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ciz_oePjw>||
(-> not `inline`d -> no fun for me ;:)
(not _displayed into my country here cos of WHATEVERcensorshit_)
(into `chatting`)=
(also i am miss from time to time the old `chatTubMUD-feeling` into all of that)
(e.g. discord also here for me not running out of the box on my linux-system anymore .. have to use that shitty website-client there!)
<@151104106973495296> pls not concentrate only (or make you depend on!) that nowadays 🪩 -discochat only! (haxebot need to help into all chat-software i mean [my old friend])
(or i am not know about ... therefor i am asking here into chat-land)
only wonder why no one using into other games i mean
good to see how good was grown at now i mean (also it shows all the 3d-assets and all -> ➕ ENV/NPC-CODE INSIDE \o/ .. really really awesome ♥️ )
(no secrets -> was run from first moment of!)
i am tested caste-db code only at time as it was `born`
<@126172290667773952> do you also using `castle` and together with Aidans ECS ?
of game-creation (outside of ldtk i mean ;:)
Wonder why no one is using it also into Flixel-Area (or is there some one ?)
and is a -> `super useful tool` at now.
Also i am really was _impressed_ how much `castle db` was growing ♥️
-> all nice to see `good haxecode` \o/ 💓
on the other side
any, if it goes into "scenes" (2d/3d) heaps did all also little bit -> hacky
( into calling the `render` from there ;:)
or heaps inside of Limes gl renderloop
( into render-context and 2d/3d scenes there)
my peote-view inside of heaps
what would be more easy to integrate
.. so after thought about into `game-loop`
interesting into heaps is that they do all more into simple also
really!
but also focussed
heaps is cool (was looking long into sourcecode how to inject peote there)
but peote-view is on Lime-Base .. so also -> andoid(hxcpp) native and all more out-of-the-box to create simple samples
Was interesting to see also into last video/audio-session of shirogames how they focus only on hashlink and hashlink->c + html .... (the targets!)
[not cos i am not like -> it would make only all to much complicate into building for html also to show the prototypes to someone i mean]
(also need no midi)
to build up on like lego!
sure .. but i am need it crosstargetstable into lime (same gl targets what peote-view is can run into)
(not crosstarget yet 😢 )
will definitively play around more into here also this year: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/soundsynth/openAL/src/SinWave.hx#L58>
(element.x -> stereo & element.y -> filter)?
Would that be `possible` 🤩 ?
<@694560611601743893> like if "protracker" would have not 8, or 16 tracks ... -> 1001 it should have nowadays (or like is what i am can imagine would be best into sync with peote-view elements-behavior)!
(i am only know how todo by opengl ... not sure how we can using this also to mix 1000 sound-samples together -> p e r Frame [and at 2d postition and sampletime-offset] )
into sound it need to be different into optimization i am think
but instead of buffering all new graphic-Element-positions
to get that -> noisy-effect <- at the end (the more raindrops is spawning the more -> noisy)
peote-audio should play them all (into depend of 2d-position or more params) -> mixed together!
so for example if i am let fall 1000 raindrops down by peote-view...
i am think it needs a new crossplatform tricky buffering-mixing-technique
(should auto-fit to hardware!)
and if to much playing at the same time .. only the nearest should get priority
or like : many sound-`sources` at 2D-screen-position
(needs -> soundsample -> `Element`s ;:)=
-> `peote-audio` <-
Half, i am think some day i am also will need your help into
( somewhere on some disk into chamber 😂 )
( i am really created 3 songs there into my Amiga-Times!)
ProTracker \o/
\o/ yeah ... a u d i o *hugs
what do you tryed out into ammer yet ?
(wanna highlight also my glsl-code into little code-widget sometimes e.g. for shader-editor)
glsl-grammar at now :(
what only makes me thinking into trisitter is that i am was not found an
-> wanna concentrate on editor-functions .. and while i am into _refactoring_ now for that "undobuffer"-feature .. its is near to what is -> query <- into trisitter workflow i mean (can be refactor and implement  both than together!)
for me alone would be to much _splittig my mind_ i mean
Or would that also good maybe for playing around with the new `ammer` on native-c(pp)-targets ?
lib (what wraps around the rust-natives and the node/web-ones to only have one end-API inside of ui-codeeditor-tools for)
wanna have that -> separate!
i can make some -> testing sandbox then with peote-ui to let explore how it works with that "queries" if code was changed (and only what letters have to change color etc.)
<@694560611601743893> do you think you could write the haxe-externs for the trisitter-web js ?
(only for web/node at first i mean)
and then trying out to build the existing nvim-trisitter-haxegrammar also into a wasm->query-folder ... to have it into haxe
my plan is to try out with this sometimes: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-tree-sitter>
(at runtime!)
a whole IDE would need year of work, but if there is undobuffer and syntax-hl ... we can using for some bot-scripting fun at first
<@694560611601743893> or we using peote-ui for our own haxe-editor 😂  (will try out _trisitter for web_ there next time) -> <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/CodeEditor/>
into the future.
into hope that not same will go there like with `Atom` at now 😭
or also using -> vscode (a free build with no-marketplace and copilot!)
maybe will dive more deeper then into (n)vim and that configs for haxe there
If i am can not run it here sometimes i am will need also another fulltime-IDE
so if you asking me -> needs a fully -> `rewrite` <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
But allways it was problem to use with `mono` on linux
so no problems *lol
also no more new `.Net` version,
now, since microsoft closed support for win7
(problem of HD was allways the `.net` depends)
you mean a -> fully rewrite <- 🙂 ?
even if it had some _ballast_ of old flashdevelop .. for me on old win7 here it works like a clock
What cool on haxedevelop is, that it is really fine-justifyed on haxe only
and at the end you never will miss it
maybe same as into blender .. it also needs years at first into using ..and step by step finding out more
(autocomplete there sometimes gimme the fully stack .. not sure what i am did not yet into configuration)
but i am still using it from time to time for little code-changes on linux
or _eating_ my _code_ or something 😂 ~~
i am get afraid that it will getting unstable or for me a non-understandable behavior
for simple ide-users its to hard to figure out sometimes (for me also to complex to open the box fully ;:)
(or into c-tags .. all the tool the vim-coder is _familiar_ with i mean)
cos everytimes its goes deep into dependencies of other plugins maybe
cool would be only 1 and superstable "haxe" plugin and no more
jupp
(*lol;:)
(its _life_ :;)
yeah .. its really an own micro-biological-system
pure vim from debian-repo i am also fully trusting i mean
if there to much "addons" (what i am not really understanding!) its not good for me
yes.. really complex there .. also i am not sure sometimes what the "lua" code is doing there behind the wheels
-_
i am really not found out yet how to _jump to declaration_ and _back_ there yet 😅
Do you also continued trying/using (n)vim on linux since we installed it here together last summer ?
only problem there: it complains at start that there is a new version out *LOL
and if you have opened 2 files(e.g. different versions of) it makes super -> diff-view
ctrl+alt+c
(can easy split windows ... i am often also using the "diff" addon!)
absolute
yeah, thats also good (even Nicolas was using into last video-session 😂 !)
(was really ok for haxe... also superfast with that "superstrings" ;:)
(do you also used atom into the past somewhere ?)
by microsoft
and many haxe-people was spend its time to write the addons there to make it a good haxe-IDE also ~_~
it was also a great hype around into 2016
(good that i didn't used it more later!)
on my computers here.
such things makes me angry all the time (same as flashplayer EOL) ...
cos i am remember i am was spend also days to make Atom at that time haxe-compatible
mhm, is that true or fakenews ? (into web only found this by fast googling: <https://www.howtogeek.com/810186/atom-text-editor-will-officially-die-later-this-year/>)
apropos, someone told me last time that the "Atom"-Ide was getting eol or something ... ?
the perl-one really was better into other things (e.g. all of snippet-access and directly invoking CPAN modules and other crazy tooling stuff there)
and that was really 20 times slower into _Typewriting_ ... buuuut
Later i am was trying the new Perl-Ide-writtin-IN-perl -> `Padre`...
(most liked the `folding` there)
i am was used it years for my jobs at that time into perl on serverside
LOL
have also: fte-console, fte-terminal and fte-xwindow
do you tryed it ? ( `aptitude install fte` only)
(also computers are faster nowadays .. you not see it anymore how slow all is into)
(maybe therefor not much was using it later)
jo
(to change the config you have to build it inside by the fly ;:)
yeah, fte is fastest on x86
(only used often fte -> ultrafast)
never tested
i love vi throught ssh into terminal

to keep the `form` more _simple_ ( ear, mouth and -> especially EYES can be
should i am `cut` that `little nipple off` off my _mesh_ data ?
what do you think (into my little blender-rework tonight) ...
where is the nose and what is the `ear`
by the was ... after did that today .. i am ask me now :
><

gpt-MC then also builds your the blocks (lesser data and more easy as into hires-image-generation)
( and all connected to GPT then -> la grande buffet 🤣 )
Sometimes i am think microsoft only will do there its own -> `meta` -> verse there *lol
why the funk also the origin minecraft was sold ?
<@215582414544699393> why the free-minecraft engines is not same as the `main`-trunk ? (why so less people using it i am wonder)
How could that be possible by "mods" nowadays ... i see no really chance out of using some of the open-source projects there ... "free-craft" and friends i mean.
(that implementation at that time even was into a never _smalltalk_ bounty!)
you was able to see whats going in into the other minecraft-like server
so if you was looking throught that "portals" there ..
i mean the "texture" + angle of view (into 3D)
to the other -> that was connected throught <-)
(also the rendering from portal-`view` from one server was shared ...
(to jump from one "server"-instance to another)
with `portals`...
there was some `concepts` at that time ...
What i am miss there is also the -> `decentrilization` into networking-mesh
and you even can `code` since that `redstones`i mean
young childs and friends here all playing minecraft ( -> best into `creation`! )
(i am would be happy if would learn more -> linux ... but minecraft engine also very cool i am think to learn how to create things [out of thats not free software {or independent anymore}.. this is what only i am suck into])
and don't know also about security-holes inside of java
umven is really young
or outside of that
is that all working behind the m$-wall ?
there into minecraft (^_^)

pls tell me the _full story_ pls!
anyway .. do you have good -> code-editor inside of minecraft to control your npc-bots? (or to write own little `quests` ? )
(where "minecraft" only was a -> `prototype`)
the `smalltalk` version i am played sometimes (that with the `portals`)
-> for me == mud
for mojang you have to ask other ones ..
As minecraft was starting , it was not like that.
thats how you getting into -> _Slavery_!
wtf
DCE that -> telemetry out pls!
or -> bounty
i mean .. did it connect to microsoft-servers ? (your version)==)=?
can you run it locally only (and by proxy?)
(or to slow then?)
have to be -> tor
for some of -> `free credits`
need it the `token`
or is your _Server_ really -> independent ?
(they will also running the same into next 20 years!)
better use free-minecraft persistent ones
i mean -> paywall
hey, keep into mind that all what you are creating into minecraft you can maybe not load again into never versions
sounds hard ... where you are dived into at now into code-space ?

<@302211105151778826> or do you have the fully 64-bigdata-set (`sieve`) already to _continue_ by that ?
( anyway -> i am wanna see it into my _samplespace_ there [ thats some of the `fundamental things` i am love )
( what is really stupid .. .same stupid as into calculating PI ... cos there is `pre`-calculated ones already -> only need to `download` ;:)
( or at least the 5 biggest ones 😂 )
we can allways using -> `-l littleBigInt` on top ;:)
(if the haxebot timeout is to short to calculate all into 32/64 bit adress-space
lets better do this now inside of haxebot here!

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieb_des_Eratosthenes
Crinfarr where do you started into that `prime` and non-`formula`-rationales ;:) into numberspace i mean ?
me also feels to old sometimes for new numpy + jupyter ENVs 😅
(haxe is out of perl and the _common_ my `main` lang at now since many years)
How is your feeling into haxe and that ... only was looking one time into your code at github last week.
wanna keep my haxecode _understandable_ uKnow.
(formula only works with Floats by default ... need to _bountybranch_ that code there _into some way i am not sure yet_ [ i am hope not by <T> or macro :;] )
for me sometimes cool would be my super-old `formula` lib together with the last `littleBigInt` lib
?
for _special case_
or do you writing your own ?
can you do that with my lib also ?
`lim_{n->oo} (1/n)*Sum_{k=1..n}` ?
ah, ok
hey, me to into littleBigInt
nowas FPU-hardwarespice ?
ah, so using fast floats for optimization ?
and don't know that `math` is the B A S E  for!
<@302211105151778826> <@215582414544699393> most here only wanna create and sell ( 🛒  ) -> computergames
uKnow 🙂
not into haxe yet
Was longer ago for me also ( maybe i did that 5 times only into my life)
(starting by number `zero` ~~)
Before that -> simple sieve pls to here ;:)!
(lets port it into haxe and put into my `bench/` folder :;)
where is the _algorithm_ there?
so you only have to type: `hxp bench <name of file into bench-folder> <target1> <target2> ...`
any, for me totally interesting also is to see how fast each ones of operations is on the different platforms (and the data-type i am using behind to store and calculate arbitrary into)
so its super - slow (don't use it if you have time-critical stuff ;:)
You have to know that my main-goal into that was to make it `most stable` on all haxe-`out`-languages
cos that means -> also np into macro-context \o/
<@456226577798135808> makes me totally happy that it also runs into --interprete 🌅 ...
(we can write it down into haxebot here at now)
cool would be the holy sieve of Aristhoteles there!
new bench samples here are very welcome (for all!) : <https://github.com/maitag/littleBigInt/tree/master/benchmarks>
<@302211105151778826> do you need large prime-numbers ?
aah ok
what is that ?
_seeYa_ 🌊
any -> everyone needa sleep from time to time ( z o n ;)
gnu c is the goal for me to (onto that shitty Operation Systems nowa)
to increase the chance that some one buying that shit
sometimes i am think they making that `"comunity"`-editions extra buggy...
(before it could ... -> they starting new version)
ms ones also have bugs what never getting fixed
thank you flut
\o/ YEAH
not from _within_ haxe ?
( i mean i am sometimes using javascript direct `call` from inside of haxe if only for that `target` )
+ asm
inline c into haxe
(e.g. you wanna do some c/++ target-optimization)
nah how you optimize your hxcpp code with direct inline assembler i mean =
how was it into haxe (was seen sometimes) into including c(any)-code direclty into haxe together with __asm ?

By the way, after this unbelievable disaster today, I've also become a bit smarter about who I like and who I don't like here.
i have a new _starter sample now to let ⚓ other pure lime opengl-coders into my `Display`-List at now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/customDisplay/_starter/src>
why you did that ? (nanji often was helping me and i am also like if he send link to sample into his codestack)

also no non-main dancing-hall for you into your town so often ?
I am was into a disco last times here with old friend .. and it was really not the same (also the music was much -> remixes only ~_~)
(but that is easy on linux-tools)
(there also was same problem [into sandbox-mode] .. was need another chrootJail around allways!)
(into irc i am often used perl at that times!)
really wonder why that not is still implemented inside of haxe
so it not needs all that hacks to make it -> `sandbox`-safe (what you did at now for disord to not let hack your personal computer where it is running all the time)
i am think a tool like try.haxe could be also used like a `service` into _multiverse_ sometimes...
<@231872730478280705> is the `matrix` users on your `holyServer` also have sucha-cool-feature ?
to make it cross-chat-software compatible!
(into `git`-habbitate)
you should better `concentrate` on haxebot-code i am think!
so like a doorman into 🪩 - entry ... or more like the dancers on nowadays -> influencer-stages there ? (into physically real discostages i mean) ?
there should be at least 3 admins!
e.g. for a "real" good "community" discord-server (whatever that could be) ...
i like _flat or best -> zero_ hierarchy into that
-> `manager` like ?
who is prising/praying about something
nah .. anyway ... only hope you are not like that -> influencers nowa
that makes me sad -_-
i am thought you are also a freaky coder
WHAT 😨 ?
what do you wanna _share_ with me ?
?
also not into offtop
;)
(for me .. so long ago -> can't remember)
or your last haxebot or try.haxe littleHelper ?
so what was last time you helped someone into coding here ?
is that same as i would say only : `maybe` ?
What do you think <@151104106973495296> if someone say `perhaps` to you ...
better to start into something like old c64-game: "international karate" or simmiliar!
"Super Smash" is to much -> `chaos` <-
but for a _2D-fightning_ it needs also additional meta-data ... e.g. also some additional `hitboxes` or hierarchical animation structure (can be complex!)=
i need into `format` like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/bulby/assets/bulby_spritesheet.png>
_samples?_
your _faforite_ `tool` ?
what is your creation-tool for animation-frames ?
i am ever wan't to create this for peote-samples (only have assets from <@215582414544699393> at now 😭 <http://www.maitag.de/~half/2023/bulby-tiles/> )
do you have spritesheet graphics created for ?
mhm, can not really do this at now .. sry ;) ... you have to ask wolfram-math!
ooor (last try 😂 ) ...
mhm... or was it this ...
mhm, not really sure formula can do it ... lets try ...
you could use `formula` lib ;)

oh, found something new motive into my old fractalset:

Thought about to extend my event-system to `add` more than one event-handler function to all events like `resize` etc. but at the end i am sure now to only allow 1 handler or `null` to keep it fast and also more simple into this (not like addEventListener ... removeEventListener queue as into most UIs)
so lesser code into sample if i am have some `.bindToSlider(myHSlider)` (all what is marked as red ;:)

need some helpers at now to make it more easy into bind the Slider-widgets to the UITextPage and UIArea ones (for scrolling)
(i am happy to have my own little ui in haxe now)

ah

Will be interesting if google enters in (cos they are need more _correct answers_ for "search-engine" maybe)

maybe into this year there will be more other service also where its more easy to get access then
thanks anyway that you have looked there 🫂 ...
have now also no more desire for gpt ... thats to much (e.g. they also get our training-data for free!)
oh, i thought there was also free access for little access (like into germans deepl)

wanna know my idea into "peote"->gpt-sample 🙂 ?
(also from inside of our not so popular `haxe` spice)
it should be easy to ->simple<- use!
All also -> json -> data-packages
(before of the transport secure layer)
how do you `debug` the network-protocol while _testing_ ?
(especially on windows!)
over "secure" sockets on TOP of -> all more complicate
(all is -> `string`!!! :)
http is really easy on top of TCP
do you know `netcat` ?
to implement ?
haxe to complicate ?
why you not _finish_ what you _started_ then ?
no idea ?
( <@151104106973495296> do it inside of haxebot also if it makes it easier for you! [will extract out also only the _relevant_ part for me than later if all is _working_] ~ ~ )
any way ... <@456226577798135808> whats your next project then into ?
(the old melenium-quest;:)
the thing with the old `turing`-machine/`band`
what mostly interesting me into base-researching is
{still have _managed_ to get some _free API KEY_ for haxetesting that new _turing-near_ stuff}
<@456226577798135808> and why do you was gimme that `hope` at first (^_^) ? [to also have chance to try out by simple api into my faforite language here]
(i mean _before discord new chat-software into_)
(i am asking me)
why you are so much -> discord - DEPEND OF ;:) ?
(only `telnet` and old `mud` engines can maybe also "extended" by this new kind of turing-complete-experiment ;:)
and since my peote-libset have good text-support at now, its would be fun to do something with
<@151104106973495296> if its only for web-target it would be also fully enough for me to play around a little bit (have some ideas for peote-samples ;:)

sure, you told me
hey Furret ... reborn from the dead-side ?

<@151104106973495296> or a little `bounty` ;:) ?
What would be easier ... a new rewrote or build on top of <@456226577798135808> s  code there ?
<https://github.com/FurretDev/hxopenai/commits/main>
(his original goal i am remember also was for a disco-bot)
into make it ->  `pure haxe`
i am not sure Furret was give up
(i am can using also then so one more pairs of eyes is looking at the _bindings_ later to!)
please please please please pl .... e ase -> make simple pure haxelib!
<@151104106973495296> i mean all here tryed this out (even some of my childs) ... but i am not yet 😭 
( wan't to wait until there is a good "haxe"-thing what i am can using 😢  -> but NOTHING yet ~_---)
if there is some npm i mean ... can this not also be used to translate automatically typescriptsave into haxe (like what do you also using to keep the disco-api allways haxe-up) ?
the _interfaces_ to all programming languages i mean ? ... or do they have some captchas what is need to ship around? =
(or is that not really "open" at now anymore while they are using for -> final-training at now ...
is it really the haxe-http implementation what lacks ?
<@151104106973495296> sorry ( feel _fuzzy_ :;) ... anyway ... why we have no lib where everyone of us here can using chat-gpt also -> crosstarget by http(s)
they are doing with me again.
and dogs _thinking_ is maybe:
from -> _humanity_
`hu` -> `men` pleaaaase *LOL
hey deepl -> "mensch" is not only "man" 🙈

this was my `last` commits today: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/commits?author=maitag&since=2023-03-01&until=2023-03-10>
-> alone-painting also -> superturboboring <- ^^^]
<@325721583073230848> my Blender-program is still not changed since i am chatting here to you ;:)
[but thats OK ... cos all my codingjob was gone today and i am prefare food conversation with you
(do you wanna code a `mud` 🙂 `engine`?)
is it _essentially_ for your game to let all change and explored at runtime ?
And ... Arfilish .. whatfor you need so much of Reflection-API (also enum-tools?) .. i am formyself not using often (only enum abstracts and such)
(reference performance test sample)
is heaps also have the "bunnymark" ?
How is the build-time into heaps ?
(maybe after <:flixel:230369617774641152> there will be no-comeback laterToSomethingOther;:)
then better try out kha before lime+libspace
so heaps was the first haxeframework you tryed ?
( or -> NDA 🙈 ? )
<@921126139664166952> whats your actual project-link into ?
(but maybe also only some _missconfiguration_ here into my old&dusty i d e *LOL ;:)
(only some compiler -> warnings <- nowadays i am wanna disable [cos of macros])
since `haxe 4` there also was _nothing_ what could not be _resolved_ for me

(try.haxe -> is my `resolver` then.)
more bug into my _thinking_ only.
its often by me only and not a bug inside of haxe ...
(only the relevant part of code what producing that bug into!)
before you put into main-channel here!
make a try.haxe sample and often you will find out by yourself also
maybe your @from/@to then only have little bug
(i am not using floatpoint so often into different precision -> only arbitrary integer numbers into that!)
try to put all into simple try.haxe sample!
is this your own code ?
the type-casting-problem from f64 - thingy ?
oh, i am remember from main-channel ...
that really helps also into learningflow
write also some samples for us or other heaps users
cool
(for the peote-bulby-sample i am EXTRA also put all into ONE FILE [only for <@215582414544699393> ;:])
thats also works by haxe-default!
thats supereasy into lime...and libs on top there
into _buildprocess_ ?
oh, you wanna have a -> `standalone` binary at the end ? (all `media` includet?)
what format ?
file?
to move a sprite from a to b ?
or how is into heaps ?
actuate ?
(wanna use it by my haxe)
is `distracting` me a bit
alone that i am have to -> login there by web-page
-> only _deflection_
my blender also still open
looking how the others doing thing i am forgot -> really important!
.. e.g. into my `peote-text` lib i am have 120 API-calls whats -> `public`)
(into little libs its np i am think ... problem is the huge the frameworks goes ...
and more into Readme
yes.. we are have not the time also to make some _illustration-graphics_
(who knows whats going on inside the sourcecode only i mean out of us haxe-natural-readers)
(they doing much into FBO there for GL)
its internal structure
What i am miss is that OpenFL not have such info-graphic about
[more a petri-net *lol ]
this is the holy `peote` graph ;:)
https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/doc/PeoteView.png?raw=true
`scene` or  `render` -> graph
and normally ... stuff like this have a ->
exact .. -> this kind of stuff into "peote" view is -> `trivial`
OpenFL also have no "camera"
apropos "cameras" and 2D ... iam e.g. only using -> xOffset and yOffset for my called `Display`s inside of peote-view
-> humanlike!
grow slow
start slow
where is problem there ?
its under construction maybe ;:)
(normally we have a haxebot -> deepl 🌉 at here ... but sometimes [like now!!!]
np
from ?
or where you getting your -> FEEDBACK
i mean to write a game to play for you alone then ?
oh, and what will give you the holy "motivation" then ;:) ?
(or sometimes the buildtime will getting so long thats no more practical anymore)
(let all _parts_ -> `seperat testable` !)
for "advanced" -> never MIX it
(that was really a short visit ;:)
to look how they getting -> compressed
i am sometimes was putting _Coins_ on TRAMWAY-RAIL t520
(and for games for sure also the tools for -> game-mechanic)
sound.
and
graphic
versus
pure haxe
to allways  `diff`into
what important for me is
you can do also Kha (graphics level < 5) or OpenFL or  .... <:lime:567735656361492490> pure Lime (<-like me)
(little bit like the old -> tweenlite)
(my faforite there is -> actuate by signmajesty)
ah.. maybe Flixel all have that integrated into ones
(-> much of _sugar_ there and to much s p i c e 😂 )
(i am only know what happens into OpenFL .. soup)
oh, is there many ones who depends on this framework to ?
mhm.. on top of heaps or of haxe ?
why not using try.haxe or bot here at more ?
`nication`
-> and   `commu`
-> learningOnlyByDoing ;:)
oh, whats up ?
( any -> there the _migrationprocess_ should be much easier as into opengl-wrappers to graphic 2 )
( shit .. also not haxe-crossframework 😢 out of the box -><https://github.com/maitag/input2action/blob/main/src/input2action/Input2Action.hx#L10>)
( <https://github.com/maitag/input2action> have only very small -> lime-dependencies ;:)
(using other lib there for keyboard-shortcuts)
my hope is that sometimes one of the fnf-modders maybe will using
( np *hugs ~~ )
(there its compatible to)=
also don't know anyone will using my stuff into <:flixel:230369617774641152> sometimes
... don't know anyone who is need or have to be fun into _migrating_ this to kha yet)
So i am really need -> fast text-editor (but its all only based on haxelime at now ..
should also be used (or implemented )
i understand that only what really is need
(but into more it goes -> critical)
its ok for a line ... or 200 also
Into most haxe frameworks the text-editor-features lacks -_-
no one would using it then (inside of game i mean!)
and if there is many code-lines and feels hard to edit ...
i am allways think to change NPC-code at runtime ...
(only if you type text inside ... and sucha ... how it feels into reactiontime i mean ....
. .. if i am build same here for neko my ones also lacks with more than 2000 textlines or so ...)
i am think ;:)
no extern profiler is need
(against holy KHA and Ians code there i mean 😅 )
was totally happy into -> performance bechmark there
peote: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/edit-spinoza/>
Ian send me good link last time: <http://haxeui.org/shared/kha-textarea/>
no no -> peformance only
(sry... but that was really fun last time)
or is your videogame not so much ... text-intensive 😂 ....
kha-text-input renderspeed agains peote-ones :;)
oooh... then you can compare *LOL ....
(my faforites is lime , json2obj and also tink_cli !)
What haxelib do you using often ?
also trying out the samples after ?
?
so you working in a _team_ ;:) = ~~~
How is your working-approach into learning new coding-things, libs and simmiliar ?
whats absolute perfect to see sample + sourcecode together
Half did last time put them there also into CI -> <https://jobf.github.io/peote-view-samples/> (peote-samples .. not only "view"! )
(cos they more is _samples_ -> the more we don't need to do that _booring_ documentationwriting into there)
mhm, to let "change" that "@formulas" at runtime ... i am not sure it would be better into the "rain"-particles there ?
no no -> all _handmade_ by me and haxefriends here!
yep, <@694560611601743893> and me never can use all of that "secret"-features into our lifetime 😂
-> alone <- (^_^)
(only tested it ones times here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/ShaderInjection.hx#L183> )
(so long ago , totally _forgot_ how to using this feature by myself to change all there at runtime for into formula)
not sure how to "catch" an -> glsl-compiler-error
```haxe
@posX @constStart(0) @constEnd(800) @anim("X","pingpong") @formula("xStart+(xEnd-w-xStart)*time0") public var x:Int;
@posY @constStart(0) @constEnd(600) @anim("Y","pingpong") @formula("yStart+(yEnd-h-yStart)*time1*time1") public var y:Int;
```
i should do a Sample on Bulbies there where you can change formula (by peote UITextLine) at runtime
(that "formula" also can be changed at runtime ... it re-compiles the shadercode then on demand!)
that needs some work i am think ;)
for each raindrop here: http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/rain/
-> no need of x and y position anymore! <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/rain/src/Rain.hx#L11>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/rain>
or look like this:
e.g. you need more colors or custom vars
it is to only put into GPU-Buffer what you need to pump into shader-vertex-variable-queue
works _fullycrosstarget_ ;:)
here it is: <https://github.com/openfl/lime-samples/blob/master/features/graphics/SimpleImage/Source/Main.hx#L120>
http://www.maitag.de/~half/2023/bulby-tiles/
here is also sample how to use the spritesheet into animation then: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/bulby>
loading and processing by haxelime and peote-view
imagemagic (from inside sh script) -> texture-atlas
blender -> image sequence
(thats the src and blend file is also there!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/normals>
yeah, i am know this pixel-technique .. any.. have my own blender-haxe-setting at now for
(by mousewheel you can change light-z direction to!)
Sixtoe, i am also wan't to do something like this later: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/normal-lightning/first-test/> for all game-env and -charactere on screen
have some workflow there already what i am should use at now ... anyway.. some where have to -> _start :;)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/shaders/normals/assets/statue_normal.png>
( iam also wanna use my "displacement"-mapping and all later for lightning ...
wanna try to see how something looks into 32x32 pixels at the end
anyway, i should start with a new char (my "hairy"-one is to complex into shapes ;:)
since 2.6 and now after new UI all is really perfect into blender (before 2.4 it really was little bit hard ... there was also times you need to know to press "q" to quit it ;:)
ways to do something.
into blender all is much more intuitive and you have thousands (what maybe is the problem for much people)
not really useful!
also later after they put "bones" inside (all after macromedia flash 8 also was -> buggy and non-haptic anymore!)
into flashs old "shape" and tweening there it was allways a mess with the controlpoints
( or like to keep a low-poly ... can be all into simple "mesh" then and not need more complex surface-types)
its to keep all -> quad surfaces to let them subdivide by modifier later only to make it smooth
but also loved the old BGE integrated game-engine (with the logic-bricks it was fun!)
yeah, nowadays also needs -> _specialization_ ... i am really love the quad-modeling part and cycles-rendering
(was also many years teaching it .. but before 2.8)
i am using blender from beginning, but still a noob into some parts of
(before -> custom interpolation ;:)
..i am even have to paint a side-view at first *lol
thats also -> `hairy`
i am think my problem into that _char_ is (to make it turn to side)
(blender is killatool !!! :;)
flash (or animate nowa) have not all the tools you need to go fully fast at the end into all you wanna do
(much points per stroke also ;:)
its really for ones who like to sketch and such ... by pen-tablet
sure, you can _interpolate_ and easy sculpting them nowadays!
... what i am definitive not wanna also is to model it into 3d (to much effort for a later lowres-spritesheet)
but time is near to let it animate ... i am really not sure to use grease-pencil
yeah ( did it into mypaint sometimes )

found it ...
iam still into _migration_ from 2.79 there ... e.g. at now i am try to find again how i am can setup a reference-image into background (or cam now) inside of blender 3.4 ... so much was changed into UI there (since 2.8 and 3 ... needs its time for me ;:)
( howto let rotate a face to side ... nowadays into blenders it seems quite easier! )
long ago i did something like this into flash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEXZ9wICeWc
mhm, but the "weightpainting"-part there is really huge work ...
so maybe it would be easier to use simple meshes instead (for armature)
and doing texture-painting onto this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uNQPYimgg
oh, found new cool video-tutorial for 2d-rigging by painting+armature ...
.... `openfl_half_round_font_sizes` -> _really <@694560611601743893> _ 😂 !
(maybe there are some more nowadays :;)
-> http://www.maitag.de/semmi/openfl/openfl-defines.txt
for OpenfL-confitionals id did some greps sometimes ago here: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/openfl/openfl-linesWith_openfl_Defines.txt>
hard to follow also is all the abstracts around GL there into Lime
(will do something like this soon .. also using vector then with a given size!)
useful e.g. to write a REDO/UNDO-Ringbuffer
should be no problem _normally_ ;:)
([same as what ms try to have ;:])
(only some weeks and its "new tool" will try to gain world domination :)
...  lobotomised ... *LOL
(ah.. i am remember to ... the other fontgenerator)
aahh... ok
(for what was it to remind*lol?)

into API
line -> pageLine -> glyph
or
page -> pageLine -> glyph
(to let the letter fly around or something ;)
yes ... a direct call to the `glyph` sprite also is possible all the time
(for icons or game-animation)
into your own custom -> unicode-ranges
anyway .. you can also put "multiple" non-packed(into"atlas")
do you combine by hand ? ( image - > magic!)
->fontforge
(i am using only this)
ah ... do you know fontforge ?
you have the fully unicode-range (depends on GPU RAM only!)
it is at now (parted into unicode or your own "ranges" by json2obs-config)
what kind of _glyphset_ is need then ?
i mean algorithm what transform turbodata into ascii
`static size`
[grid -> fixed <- then]
cool also would be to translate turbostone-lines into ascii->ansicolored .)
will try to make a sample later!
need only some new regexp-rules into parser
( ansi-colors at first :;)
( that what i am need to implement ! )

googles next will also have -> 512 *lol ;:)
also the chinese -> gpt (have more `depth` at now -.- x100)
<@151104106973495296> pls `implement` gpt also (wanna ask huxley what he would say about :)

<@456226577798135808> or only know _spinozas_ older ones ?

ah -> you wanna find and help yourself at first to help others later then ? (e.g. your family and friends)=
...
understand
lemme
ok ok
who also ...
oh, and now its the grand one

(make some own cat by some hand-made-material to `form` a -> unique cat

do you are help your father also sometimes ?
if the ones of your _father_ is like the one of _from your photo-album_
i am asking me then: how your `OWN` ones would look

<@456226577798135808> your last commit here was longer ago .. is all working now ?= (<https://github.com/FurretDev/hxopenai/commits/main>)
really will try that new "modern" (yet "open") stuff TO ...
can things like this not also be super easy implemented inside RPG-maker or something nowadays (never was using all this nice tools ... maybe i am to old)
(if the `avatar` there -> _enter_ the _classroom_ ... thats cool -> `storytelling`!)
<@126172290667773952> and while _watching_ i am really thought that the "conversation" into games like this
-> also supereasy could be _pimped up_ by new ai-spice into a non-conservative way maybe ;:)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOj87_Bte7g
what point somewhere here into: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOj87_Bte7g>
Was looking at haxe.io today and found this -> <https://community.haxe.org/t/paid-work-looking-for-an-experienced-haxe-programmer-to-make-a-deltarune-engine-position-filled/3793>
anyway, do you also think that (since gpt3 *lol) there will be also more ...
`text`-IN/OUT
inside of our poor indie-andGaming-stuff is need to ;:) =?
MSGhero: that will let `glow` my _letters_ some day \o/ ~~
( good stuff !!! )=
<https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen/files/3050967/thesis.pdf>
*sights
m.dreams (was some stickman .. would be totally cool with the  `joints`-physics nowadays together with turbostone)
( my _ooold c oooo d eeee_ 🌊 💦 💧 )
( can't run anymore 😭 )
( have some old samples here by me .. but all -> flash)
its perfect
i am also was using nape into the past times .. soo much better then box2d!!!!!!!
(only gamma11 was able to `fix` that some years ago for haxe `4`)
-> superoptimization <-
so he wrote on little parser for
there was no macro or abstract spice
the thing is .. at the time deltaluca wrotes this
jo
(do you looked into code ?)
is works -> but so many patches -..---> who ever will understand ?
into haxe!
;:) .... we only have echo and (for fully phy) box2d at now
-> make NAPE -> ready for 2023
out of @gamma11 for sure
i am little bit sad that no one of ALL THAT GAMECODERS HERE
🌅
its old stuff: <https://github.com/deltaluca/gl3font>
Halfwheat, sometimes i am think no one maybe will using peote-libs out of us!
(where is link to origin to let browse the asset-folder for py-script-tool ?)
(also .py script!)
<https://jobf.github.io/peote-view-samples/shaders/distancefield/>
hey, but there is sample already !
chlumsky -> for science
hiero -> for games
(any -> chlumsky did them all at one .. will try to clean up my code there to use only this great and modern tool)
-> better pixel-safe-font
for -> zoom-OUT
while zoom-`IN`
distance-field is good for -> sharpness
ah ok (puh) -> then NoProblem!
there!
so not wanna make your `production-code`-> not buildable anymore
yeah, you was need it for your mod-"tracker"-tool i am remember
(and any of .. its all stored into `git` .. so can be easy _reverted_ by some AI tools later!)
i am let it IN
if you will still using
ON
i am fuck what other ones have or not have
(if you not need also anymore)
(i mean i am fully _replace_ ttfcompile then!)
tell me!
eh, you are the only one who is using peote-text
or should i am -> fully migrate ?
thats the question ... do you wanna compare (then i am will leave delta lucas ttf-encoding and all inside of peote-text!)
(into deltas)
(also lesser c-dependencies!)
its slower there!
and you know why ;:)
look into the code!
lucas packing algorithm maybe better
no no no -> better chlumsky ( c++ code there looks very professional .. also the developement-process and `paper`! )
🙈
WOAHH *closing eyes immead...
( -> for ALL AT ONCE <- )
(will only using  Chlumskys into FUTURE )
me only used this also for peote-text: <https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/>
and whats up with Delta Luca ? (who will rewrite Nape _finally_ 🙈  ... )
How is heaps generating the SDF format at now ? (own generator?)
( for MSDF-type i am already have sample for the shadercode we can using! )
MSGhero: maybe we can have a tool what can be used for all haxe-graphic-frameworks then (together;:)!

my plan is to write little userinterface to make it easy to use ( but for sure -> at first it needs some shellscripts to generate proto-data to use for migration  ... and also the equivalent shadercode for each special subtype there )
<https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen>
hey, lets using -> MSDF atlasgenerator ( i am also will switch soon to this new one [ still using Delte Lucas  old SDF ttfcompile one] )
(remember only from old kha-chatting)
mhm
who is that ? ( wasn't from kha? )
MSG, how is into textperformance in heaps nowa? ( and how goes on into generally there 🫂 💓 ~~ ;)
lemme think .. was not <@126172290667773952> using heaps last time also (*hugs _throught wire_ ;:)
who we could ask ?
mhm ...
what .. 😂 ...really ?
by the way .. how is into heaps & text-performance ?
Was good to see it into Kha now ....
(out of that into _performance_ maybe *lol ... but we all know ;:)
i am sure nowadays 100% of bugs i am was found into my last usecase is fixed at now!
as i am was using (longer ago) it was working!
(no need to make again for every haxetarget)
it works super for not so much amount of text
( and for `editable = true` -> maybe only for one text-line ;:)
anyway .. the thing is -> 99% of `coders` who is `using` <:openfl:567735656017821708> + <:flixel:230369617774641152>  is not need more than max 200 textlines or so!
not sure into main-repo!
( _since paragraphs_ ... also super into multilanguage now! )
not for you .. but also pls think at all the ones who did hard working on OpenFL-text-implementation all the time ( super good improvements there also into last year! )
4sure
(how it scales to text-amount!)
but maybe a "reference"-sample would be good also to see how much it is at more amount of text
Also main-usecases is gameing .. and there is no need to render much of text
( openfl text is have to be fully flash-compatible ... thats fully different into implementation also for -> more than only opengl-rendering! )
why do you think ?
<@694560611601743893> -> think like another kind of `bunnymark`
[i mean .> its _only text_ ! ]
[have 3 different amount of test-asset also ... so look how it _scales_]
(^_^)
into Hegel
after -> keypress
only wanna -> count the seconds
(and you to half!)
mhm... only <@385014891750096896> gimme allways 😭 good samplecode
to `compare`
i need -> sample
🙂
wanna -> train ?
<https://api.haxeflixel.com/openfl/text/TextField.html>
apropo moneyp .. do you good into Openfl or Flixels -> `TextArea` ?
(iconogpraphics -> FUN!)
🥚 🥚
and that freenode was not `free` anymore!
i think it was cos of slack maybe
or lets open a "haxe" darknet instance!
<https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/502857487888809985/1082386424684363787>
or lets make a "gnu-net" haxe - channel!
aptitude install hexchat -> and it goes on!
or use ui-one -> hexchat is ok!
you have to invite more ... -> and the _show goes on again_ ;:)!
nowadays everywhere is -> data-EATERs (bots mostly!)
telnet ;:)
ok, i am not will joining in now
nah, maybe he is using a pseydonyme
*lol
(or only nicolas ;:)
who is there ?
you are welcome
*lol
yeah 😅 ... or ask gptX
iam sure there is also i3 or arch-linux discochatservers open somewhere
ask into main-channel ... some is here to... who doing things like this professional (but on arch mostly!)
there is much good Rust-Samples you can using for!
eh sorry ;) ... i am only so happy that after all the years of hard of coding ...
now my text-rendering and ui works so fast (faster then flash and also looks the same on all targets \o/)
but don't put it into the washing-machine then ~^
you can put a flexible little LCD on the cloth there (+little raspi-mini into your pocket)
*LOL
(i will write the image-magic script to put all frames into spritesheet!)
lets better do a 2d-animation into blender for the old msdf-spice there (what is only for "still"-img at now!)
(if you load many files into parallele only)
here last times into lime was little bug ... but since latest lime-release it was fixed for neko
(you can put also some `try .. catch` statements around!)
all haxe-targets should work for tink_http out of the box!

oh oh ooooohh   -> OOOUHH
can you make also pure tink_http test ?
mhm... haxe-ui ....
(cpp!)
was getting -> segmentation fault <- last time into _local_ multipaint-haxe-paintserver here ;)
💧
_fruityloopi_ 😂
i mean since this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy>
(problem allways is since this crutch <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing>)
(old tool for cors->ANYWHERE<- still works here for me ;:)
no idea
(put it into front of url! .. and press that "button" there to get a test-session)
or try to use heroku for testing
(if you not wanna set up own cors-server for your domain... heroku still works but needs this _procedure_ nowadays to use for _testing_)
after this you can test -> CORS
(nowadays you have to enter this at first: <http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo> and press the "Request temporary access to the demo" button!)
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/TextureCaching.hx#L87>
have some sample here what also using CORS: <https://jamesobfisher.gitlab.io/peote-samples/TextureCaching/>
(if you using heroku-ones for testing, there is need to make an "auth"-session nowadays before!)
you are using a Cors-server ?
`-D keep_inline_positions`
or try by `<haxedef name="keep_inline_positions" />` define inside project.xml (<-if using lime to)
you should look where "Error#502: XMLHttpRequest Error" appears into tinkerbellcode
ah, ok
where is `src/ArchPkgs.hx` there into tinks github repo ?
do you already was asking the tinkerbell-crew here or somewhere ?
but for a custom hxml i am think it is still need (not sure there!)
mhm, here it works (still was testing it ... if i am only have "peote-ui" inside project.xml it automatically using also the other peote-libs)
(lime did it automatically as i am remember)
or only by <:lime:567735656361492490>
oh, not only need of `"dependencies": { ...}` inside of haxelib.json ?
maybe you also need tink_core ... mhm, but normally it should have the dependence-lib automatically
hey, if i am finished my one .. i am will not have to touch anymore (the optimization and own gl-textrendering there was really a mess and to much effort 😅 !)
also you can select over many lines and it scrolls up/down then (this is also on my TODO into)
hey, looks very good implemented to 👍
(no _key-repeat_ there on html-target?)
oh, i see you also not mark the line-ends by selecting ( thats on my todo also! )
\o/ much thanks (oh, thats also ok from speed of into Kha)
no one ? 🥲
someone should test it with old words of "hegel" ! ;:)
nah, there was much improvements last years !
is someone have some OpenFL or Flixel-sample here by hand to test editable Textfield with same data? (<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55108/55108-0.txt>)
but sure all is into array of array of glyphdata
it only renders the visible (gpu-buffer)
15449 textlines (938780 chars)
( next it need to change offsets if cursor goes outside of visible ... but i am happy at now ...
 also that it works for so much amount of text-data and packed-fontglyphes for non-monospace 😂 )
Was fixing most of bugs now inside peote-ui textpage-edit-widget ...
and new SAMPLE (^_^) with super-large textdata now: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/edit-hegel/>
(it startet into ~2000)
<https://www.gnunet.org/en/about.html>
(any: gnu-net was much years before 😂 !!!)
bitcoin is also decentral and much is using it
(also on serverhosting!)
linux kernel nowadays is already very popular (its runs everywhere around of you!)
yes.. and it all cos into NAT of your internet-provider-service
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUnet>
really old one is "gnu-net" .. its also crypto+decentral (and since very very long time at now ;:)
(to keep the owner of your data)
problem there mostly is to "host your own server"
ups .. same as me to 🙈 ( i am also meant -> matrix )
(no company is collecting your data to train its AI or using for other things you don'T wanna know of ;:)
no, its free software and works decentral

what ?
to test it!
and then: `startx`
(i am edit the _config_ files only!)
nothing
ah (never used now)
for integrated gpu you will have no trouble!
( if not works -> Xorg.conf and deeper! )
i am allways install all by aptitude
ah
)
do you installed the non_free hardware and "intel"->microcode and stuff already into debian ?=
(the revisition is important for your X and framebufferstuff ...
so we have same mini-gpu on CPU ;:)
nowa (since GPU died there ...lesser powerconsume also now!)
no, only intel cpu integrated one also
(my old GTX was burned out last year!)
same

here:
ahh... interesting
and without "grep" ?
-> `lspci | grep VGA`
no need
`| grep VGA`
gimme `lspci` pls
what is your GPU ? (lspci)
into debian there was much updates and core-changings last months into X
(for outside its really not usable if the displays is reflection the global illumination i mean ;:)
only hope the LCD is have no "mirror" also (only know the old tinkpad-ones)

is it have that little red IBM button into middle of keyboard ?
new `device` to play with ?
🪗
🦌
🎄
into `team`

yeah .. you are really was missing into CREW here!
🥚 🐇
*LOL
hello `?  ?  _hellO ;:)
Monep ?
( especially the OLD thinkpad series [before of "lenovo"] )
(but thinkpads are good -> solid work with the nutches)
yeah, its hard to open and put all the components together again
nah, i am like -> `vinyl`
(digital to analogue =)
oh, is that not lost information then ?
<@151104106973495296> -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/a19b694e693608342d12b2fcd5fcdd6fc6d98eb0>
only cos of your turbopainting last night into (wanna get it -> `run` !)
`~/("lines"\s*:\s*{.*?})/`
ok . .. regexp maybe ready at now
ahhh (thx)
no
what is a `DAC` ?
XXX -> not _matches_ anymore
missing the "spacers" ... or do you generating also "tabs" ?
( i am wanna parse not billies bucket head art now by little regex )
_commit_ your own TurboData there!
jo
(i am to tired tonight [ the only i can do into _production_ at now is little regulare one ~^ ])
<@151104106973495296> ... _really_ *lol

need only to make spaces into multiple \s*
half is to lazy tonight ;:)
is "lines" allways into doublequotes ?
<@694560611601743893> i am think i am have it now ( regexp starterkit ;:)
ok, will better doing this at now then
aahhh ... therefor nobody needs it out of me ;:)
(copilot 🙈 )
[copy file -> _renaming_ twice! 1)filename .. 2) main-type name]
as only me
can be also that more people have the same problem
i like to ask you now (will remember then later if nothing more better todo inside of haxe-SYNTAX-tree ;:)
(without have to change the filename AND the type-name also inside ?)
to copy paste from a _starter -> sample-main.hx
.. to make it more easy for semmi
mhm ... is there not something we are missed to implementing...
maybe some day all is implemented and the haxe-core-team say:
maybe
wich one ?
i am know what i am would choose!
and instead of this there can be 10 bugfixes
so if this would need months to implement ...
to implement this
sure , but maybe it makes the haxe-compilercode more unreadable as it still is at now
if a exist -> go further
ex(a).doIt()
if i am wanna use the dot-syntax
or write little `ex`ist helper
i do (a != null) ? c : b
(coalescing i am not really _fan_ of by myself)
null-safity and iterators works perfectly for me since 4 (and some updates later!)
or doing a pull request
😘
we can also send mr S some beers + proposal into mailinglist *LOL ;:)
oh, what for example ?
i am have to much to code into peote (also will write that regexp soon tonight to let us play with turbostone->EDIT-FUN ;:)
-> no no -> if you NOT was asking
how can you knowing this ?
`abstract (Int)` then also only ?
mhm, but what if its not a class and an abstract ?
mhm, never seen this into perl
(by .bind spice)
(and also for optional function params)
i mean into _pattern matching_ into general
`case _:`
<https://haxe.org/manual/expression-switch.html>
really ?
it CANT be more freaky as it is now
no no (thats only haxespice)=
he also likes `_` into functionarguments
why not ?
but that would be _ideal_ ;:)
mhm, not sure its easier to implement by ocamls existing parsing code by `_`
i am allways have to "rename" -> _twice_
At now if i am copy/paste a main-sample .hx file
as `name` identifier for.
and if that _happens_ -> then it should automatically _take_ the Filename
```haxe
class _ {}```
cool would be to name a `class` also with the common haxe-replacement-char: `_`
by the way ... Half, do you know my latest haxe->PROPOSAL into ;:) ?
😆
ok -> (regexp *lol ;:)
you _prefare_ it `inlined` `?
anyway .. wanna only do: `haxelib install turbo-format` ( or turboformat without `-` )
(not sure the maintainers will _merging_ it in 😂 but why not ?)
Or you can also add it here (would be best of then ;:): <https://lib.haxe.org/p/format/>
So if you also wanna using the `data` later into some other project it will be easy and
also the code inside `turbostone-Editor` will get lesser files into folder.
so turbo-format as a little lib what only including (de/)serialization Scheme by `json2obj`
```
  ...      turbostone
     \     /        \    
      \   /         lime, peote-view and other libs
       \ /  
    turbo-format
```
should like this (from my mind) :
no, i mean i am not wanna fully have also something from your turbostone-editor-program
you have to separate the editor-code at first
( or a sub-call afterwards to pick some frame out of soup )
( + another argument for the frame number please ;:)
this is the only API-call i am need later (by your lib-format):
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/HappyBillyBucket.hx#L54>
(later we delete the regexp and also my TurboData.hx!)
so you not have to hurry to make turbostone a lib
its only 1 line (for the first frame ;:)
*LOL
so lets parse out the `HERE WHAT WE WANT`
at now its like this (for regexp..) `var json = '{"models": [{"index": 0,"name": "","lines": [{HERE WHAT WE WANT}]';`
i am would like to see to remove TurboData.hx there sometimes and only add your lib to project.xml (by hand! ;)
yeah -> portable
(why we using JSON then ? ... binary would load faster!)
no no -> it should be easy to mod it
by hand!
what if some one wanna "mod" the json later ?
maybe
(if some bugs into json-format we will easier found out at what line/pos)
yes, but errorhandling is essentiell
pls not destroy my error-handling code there 😅 !
yes ?
turbostone.LOAD()= or something!
and later: haxelib install turbostone
yeah .. then better an onliner regexp
or will replacing it ?
is it only build up on TurboData ?
but pls not bloat up the simple samplecode *praying ;:)
mhm ... then commit it pls
(only wanna NOT fix the happy bucket json by hand again *LOL ;:)
little regexp also can do -> first aid
no hurry ....
-> and only including your lib for reading the Data in again ! ;:)
wanna remove my TurboData wrapper sometimes
-> turboline-sample have to get fully back into -> 10 min only!
eh.. was need 1/2 h to understand what i am was doing into multipaint-sample
no no (this will make it harder to read into samplespace)
(can also write simple regexp at now ... and later if all is a lib+API its easier to use into peote sample-chamber)
oh.. it seems there is much for future already into turbo-format
("index" and "name" would be also good to have ... why an "index" is need if it is still `Array` ?)
what need is the "models" - array from json
(or "all" also would be turbocool!;:)
so we can grab a frame
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/TurboData.hx#L5>
better would be to extend only this here:
until the json2obj -> interoperable <- format is still into developement (for animation frame)
yes, or a little regexp
<@151104106973495296>  ok .. this still fixed now -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/a19b694e693608342d12b2fcd5fcdd6fc6d98eb0>
<@694560611601743893> i am really think about to `fix` this tonight: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/assets/happybucket.json>

plugin-space ?
(its only java .)
i am absolute sure you can make intellijijii -> 100% compatible
then every 5 years a new one or what ichi?
so better i am learning one and all the short-keys and tools-i-am-have
then (for me) it feels -> sad
and if you only know the half of or 10%
problem is that all needs its time to learn it -> fully
( [ <https://fte.sourceforge.net/> ] )
( i am _Swear_ on -> FTE !!! )
do you also tryed emacs nowadays into haxe ichi ?
(only problem maybe -> QT-lib <- for UI there *LOL 🤣 )
Therefor it was better i am think then eclipse ;:)
its for -> C/C++/C+++/C++++
why it should ?
QtCreator
yeah .. that was it (*hugs)
anyway -> the `diff` at the end was only text-fileformat ;:)
but then i am was using another IDE at that time ... into qt i am remember it was coded
(<https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/32305>)
(for my old _port_)
was building blender sometiems into intelliji also
(hard to _switchback_ i am mean if you longer not was using)
js -> maybe ;:)
php -> no
glsl -> yes
java -> no
python -> yes
(to -> migrate my brain back into that old syntax ;:)
never would _touch_ java nowadays if no one pay me for doing this
(haxe abstracts and macros also from time to time ;)
thats why i am using haxe only to -> GENERATE it
intellij -> java profies
eclipse -> studentswork
(where you only need 5 at most ;:)
1001 menu entries
and the REAL thing is -> ALL nowadays have
(java have super bad slow ui-libs also i mean)
faster then into old times ? ( i am only remember into _eclipse_ sometimes 🙈 )
by you ? (or do you need to rebuild the fully java-code then there 😂 ?)
can it be _customized_ more for `haxe` also ?
What do you are like into that old JAVA IDE ?
( or to re-run the last terminal-history command )
if i am press the -> `test` key
-> to make me -> sure that my code is `running`
multithreadingEnvironmentBehind)
(and also to -> `complex` for me -> what runs into "co"-workers or "pilots" into
-> both a little bit to slow for me (if i am type a letter in)
ichi .. i mean at end its the same ... java or js ;:)
intellij is also ok ... i am only not like cos of JAVA (what is not longer supported by 🌞 at now)
(it works better and better i the more i am dive into here into my [non trivial] configuration)
why not using vim ?
np -> gimme idea ;:)
OH.. sorry .. i am was forget to tell you that you also have to change the classname
mhm, why you named "happybucket.hx" into lower case letterstart ?
<@151104106973495296> `merged` 🌅
i am only using it into trust that all works full stable)
(this is <@694560611601743893>s code .. i am have no idea what it is doing ...
view Point (from model)
and turbotranslating into
Sorry that it still needs much of _decoding_ ,
`buffer.addElement( new TurboLine(x0, y0, x1, y1, Color.GREEN) );`
.. there is the loop how it renders the lines again )
( later into `code` there is some `// on load` ....
copy this file and only change this line at first: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/NotBillysFirst.hx#L46>
( or to _animate_ it later ... try to keep into your .hx file there so never _merging-conflict-ever_ ;:)
( to -> `customize` position and scaling of the vectorgraphics )
<@151104106973495296> only the `data` is not enough! (pls create also some .hx file there <:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218> !=)
and here only: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/project.xml#L14>
name it like you want here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src>
nothing special ... try to let it -> `run` and you will see 😂 !
and we will find a way to translate it easy into a still image format (^_^)
pls don't do it _manually_ i mean ... pls commit the `RAW` save only ...
-> to filter half out of full `format` what halfs tool gives us<-
 (to let it run.)
we should `develope` the regexp here into haxebot 😂  (hope i am not to tired ... was really huge haxecodingmarathon here last days&night)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/assets>
( out of json-turboformat proto there at now )
(pls commit it up .. i am should write that regexp at now to filter the frames out)

( moment Half -> need to _plug_ into my _graphicPENdevice_ ;:)

* takes it _thankefully_
( -> wanna have all supeRecurSive)
or into UILayout -> widget inside the other simple workflow at now
maybe i am rename PeoteUI into PeoteLayout
(wanna -> let it `MIX`)
how to let them better ->connect<-
cos of all new _samples_ at now .. i am getting new ideas uKnow ...
( the _hidden_ connection to the `peote-layout` lib by nowadays haxe-abstract-implementation )
for my ui.>non-XML i am also thought about how to do this now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/widgets/src/WidgetLayout.hx#L71> together with the "simple workflow" there
yep .. perl is like what a turing-band should `play` ;:)
perl can change its own code at runtime
don't listen to me ( i am really like how is into Perl and Data Notation ;:-)
no no -> better -> JSON
mhm ... decorating pure haxecode by XML-
interesting
(into lime i mean)
now all is stable there i am think if you enable "DOM"-render-target
mhm.. only remember the 3 ways into openfl and DOM at that time (fastest was something with `BIT` into name ... the bitcrew... bitmapbrothers... -> i am forgot -_-
(nowadays!!!)
my stuff is -> vapurware ... heaps is superstable!
(or to many bugs into by -> non-concentrated-work!)
problem allways is -> if code grows to fast and gets to hard to read after time
for me it only was `H2D` into the past sometimes
pls port peote-view to heaps!!!!! 💓
the -> nonfree -> versionjungle often (same as into linux and new Xorg or DKMS sometimes all the years also again)
(for myself: i am was stopping at Lime-Level sometimes ~~ ... openfl api i am know but for myself only using peote on top of <:lime:567735656361492490> at now)
Do you using Lime or OpenFL also for yourself or prefaring pure haxe or simple frameworks around to ?
😂 half and me have here fully ssh-acces to our _local_ raspis (but different versions ... also into debian and most sucking there i am sure is allways into -> GPU-free/nonfree/free/non/freedriver neverendingstory also there ~~)
( i am into charity with you into that )
🪡 _ear_

oh oooh oooooh

<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stille_Post>
like "Stille Post" 😅 ?
woah .. ssh access only ? (ssh -X?)
(also if you _don't_ will _findTheTime_ *hugs!!!)
(will _render_ a _fractal_ for you ;:)!
`lime test neko --app-main=BunnyMark` from sample folder
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/project.xml#L27>
after work 4sure...
Crobes, pls test out my peote-view bunnymarks also on `M1` ...
ah, interesting
(oh .. i am forgot.. for a friend 😍  ?)
or for what do you are using this unique device into your env ;:) ?
CRobes, what lime/openfl-code do you plan to get running there on M1🤖?
but maybe also SDL version was changed since that timestamp 😂 )=
have also somewhere old `diff` of that config on need (if it was more than one line!=
(remembered from 🧠 *LOL ;:)
e.g. here you can let it run into only framebuffer (without startX ;:) on raspi:
<https://github.com/openfl/libsdl/blob/eb95850b14d843955cb95bbf08d8c2041ece31dc/include/configs/rpi/SDL_config.h#L277>
found it: <https://github.com/openfl/libsdl/tree/eb95850b14d843955cb95bbf08d8c2041ece31dc/include/configs>
The other File to change was SDL-related ... moment .... (try to find it again)....
(did that only for my old raspi2 at that time ... simple `lime rebuild` and it works [ and _don't forget to write a Readme of what you was changing into_ :;)])
good into _customizing_ i mean
the best into <:lime:567735656361492490> (i am love it then) is the build.xml <https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/project/Build.xml>
ah.. the old OpenAL-sucker
yeah, lime on mac should work ( there was only 1 friend from OpenFL-chat ever who was testing all my peote-view samples there -> he sayed -> it works [also on ios] ... 
only problem: that was 3 or more years ago *lol)
oh, minimac ?
.. we who is try to use the service for _really_ free ;:)
and then the AI will be trained also to figure `us` haxe-hackers out ...
(and beside it will make a `contract` with you so you have to pay every month)
if you have a problem -> into future you will hear 📞 voice of what GPT5 is saying
tel. call to _service-worker_ there *lol
🚀
hui 🙈 ... git-itself into version there also ... oh oh ( supercool that you was _repairing_ ♥️ !!!)
( but the github servers to my IP here also sometimes -> blocking serverside  ... e.g. if i am updating all my repo-changes on other computer it takes more time the more i am get into a time-range)
ah... oh (sry ) ... -> super FIX then \o/
i am sure its the funky -> github-servers (they build that inside to
ah ... yeah (remember also now)
Will it be delivered then into next haxe-version ?
wow ... had this bug not here yet but good to see someone who comforting the old code *hugs
<@539190724030103553> whats new into haxelib ? ( if i install as a lib itself ? ... mhm 🙂 )

and how is into
ah
i am hit the limit into Display-coordinates last time (it appears from the _upper_ then 😂 :) -> 32767 pixel `+/-`
rotation there is -> fully 64 bit 4 bytes floatpointy
no no
(at what point the eye can not see anymore i mean ;:)
hey.. i am never tested that out
\o/
let us -> "simmulate" *lol

( msdf -> only textformat ... would need extra _transformer_ script ! )
ttfcompile is also -> binary fileformat at now
(the "packing" is whats affects the -> macro-generationstuff only!)
is the otherthing.
and what kind of `texture-packing-algorithm`
it need a `distance-field` meta-tag (and value!)
2 switches only ;)=
texturepacking or not
distancefield or not
( and ttfcompile is only -> SDF )
should be the new types
NO      SDF     PSDF     MSDF     MTSDF
no no no ->
the naming of the `metas` there is need to -> cleaning up <- also
good (i will try to keep it into!)
_congratulations_
<@694560611601743893> should i am let the old `ttfcomile`-format (by DeltaLuca) still into or should i am remove it from the source completely ? (more _Cleaner_ then into readingTheHXSource)
need of 5 different glsl-shadercode also!

best would be into peote-samples (for the different -> post-effects !)
to get familiar with the commandline params (to make json2obj for haxe and all then ;:)
e.g. -> little .sh script
i need a _starter there. ...
Half, this year i am will definitively make all into peote-text also 100% compatible to -> <https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen>
<:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218>
hey Bulby .. should we make some "texture"-atlas from it for you ?
(yet! ;:)
for me also
jo (only mean also for neko/hl here)
and don'T wanna know how much <:flixel:230369617774641152> takes
any -> openfl takes really longer (> * 2 )
or also only 3s (cos no peote-ui there ;:)
5 s ?
from mind
How long turbostone -realprogram takes to build?
peote-ui -> 2.5-3seconds
peote-text -> 2.5s
peote-view sample -> 2s
people also can make hq into unity or whatever!
( and all the macros there then recursively ! ! ! )
( + peote-text! )
since peote-ui i am also feel really more longer build-time for the samples there!
( 2a -> maybe longer buildtime then ;:)
2) haxe DCE will throw out all flash-related-code at the end
1) never touch a running system
to MUCH there into codebase at now but on other side i am also think :
also think sometimes that the old FLASH - BASE is
( most only using lime or only openfl or ONLY  flixel )
don't know someone tryed this also into nowadays
( that was the _origin_ IDEA ;:)
( like -> using openfl as a lib [from within of purelime] )
it was by importing the "stage" only i am _remembeR_
i did that sometimes (by sample from <@231149223855390721> ...forget where it was 😅 into _samplespace_)
anyway .. it really is possible to use "OpenFL" parts from inside of pure-lime-app-thing
poor into mass
<@694560611601743893>  poor haxelime users can't use all the _comfort_ and _wellness_ of `haxeui` without overhelming its code by importing some parts of OpenFL-`stage` i mean ... -> there `peote-ui` will _fill the gap_!
all `thx` to you here *hugs
( have to update also the README here sometimes cos there is also Page and Sliders + Area now for workflow one: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui#how-to-use> )
wanna keep it `modular` to the pure haxe + cassowary haxelib -> `peote-layout` lib also!
-> it still _twirling my mind_ into there of namespace (but only there! .. much is already _stamped_ at now)
you know what i mean *
and PeoteUI into PeoteUILayout
PeoteUIDisplay into PeoteUI
last time i am thought about ... to rename
2) -> PeoteUI (thats the more "comfort" one what is using peote-layout lib!)
1) -> all manually placement and adjustment ( PeoteUIDisplay )
so i am still keep on the old idea of `2`-workflow there
more into what is the "basic" - > "lego"-like `bricks`
(not bloating like XML-stuff for sure ;:)
more as it is at now ;:)
cos wanna make it not bloating
jo .. i am need to change it
exactly
stability is not the problem!
peote-view is superstable (also into API minimal and only can improved at now on top of there .. e.g. into texture-format sometimes [TextureData is best i did into the last time there!!!!!]!)
i am not using it also for myself (only into samples)
Much is also working nowadays into peote-ui ... but wanna until things can change into API
can make also ui-prototype (but have to improve it more here first .. needs its time to get fullyusable)
hey, turbostone is also fresh into next years (it peote-view is changing -> i will fix your code!)
i will write a little regexp
if more data floating inside ->
no _stress_ ...
( the `Main.hx` is the _default_ haxelogo by half 💯 )
feel free to change also the `haxe` code into here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src>
by the way ... NotBilly ... are you still there ;:) ?
not sure but maybe it will be sometimes like if you using data at now for like a `collage` or something
what data can be used for AI-tools (the trained "models"-Input)
there is much _discussion_ now here into europe about ...
(<https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/computer-und-kommunikation-25-2-2023-komplette-sendung-dlf-f5240010-100.html>)
to train its AI and sucha illegal things!
data from users (without asking!)
have heared today into radio computerscience-news that they also used
ENV
-> its GULAG
what likes that behavior.
yes .. and i am sure its hard to find good coders
or are too stingy to spend money on it
apple managers maybe not find good programmers
(after they destroyed macos before)
BSD i mean was a good choise
and -> marketing ROI shit at most
jo
yeah -> apple for loosers ;:)
(was that "lion" or something into brand-name)
not working -_-
-> 1 week of work (bootstrapping without an end)
Into early haxetimes .. i am really tryed to install haxe on some old Tupper-Ware there
apple makes it HORROR nowadays
(to _keepstable_ ~~)
(for Rudy ;:)
do you was using often for gamejamfun?
<@151104106973495296> was rendering also the fractal-image last time (sry cos of wrong channel 😂 !) over night: http://www.maitag.de/semmi/blender/mandelbulb/forR_01.png
.. to make usable sometimes also for Yanrishatums cool new lib to let read `Tiled`-editordata  inside of peote-view)
( also thought about .. i mean since we have sample now for Ldtk ...
we need the json-config _shared_ by a little haxelib
thank you NotBilly <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/c2e46744ba548d31ec472cb9fe8fcba70f182267>
*hugs <@151104106973495296>

AHH.. have it
eh.. not long and i am will need a regexp ;:)
ah..there are 3 into now
have to allways -> save!
(^_^)
ah.. thats -> ui-glitch
no, there was only empty frames then

second is
do you sure you send me not the old .json
i mean: letters are -> fontready ?
(have to do this by hand all the time 😅 )
ah ok.. moment....
i am only copyed the first

the first one is
at what frame it is ?
WOW
<@694560611601743893> or is the "letters" still into one image ?
So this can be used e.g. to center the images there!
did also created some new util for better "align" (halign + valign together ;:)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/util/Align.hx>

Then you only have to put all the button-art into one image (transparent png)
or only texture+tilenumber
.. not sure to use the "TextureCache" there to
yep 🙂 ... but will need also a new style there for make all "textured"
so maybe <@694560611601743893> can sometimes using easy for turbostones grid-sliders!
and needs "discrete value" list for parameters (also something into "range" for output),
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/style/SliderStyle.hx>
I am only improved little bit the peote-ui _Sliders_ today (now can make more custom _draggersizes_ ) .. but still not finished fully (needs also better way to _scale_ automatically to some scroll-area inner/outer into _draggerlength_
cool also was "Erlang" - p.-language!!!
ah ok (much new there!)
(never heared about .js there)
<https://www.scala-lang.org/> this one into js-version ... mhm ?
_use_ haxe -> _generate_ js 😂 !
_fallback_ is allways good for web
check also if it only supports webgl1
`about:config` page ->     `webgl.disabled = false` or  `webgl.force-enabled = true`
mhm, if its older firefox, may you have to enable manually
(maybe only have to be enable)
what webbrowser ?
and give us some cool music links!
or try to be professional user of haxe ( same of learning_time )
Bubly -> you gets more and more lost -> learn Perl5 ( calculate 3-6 years! )
(out of game i mean!)
into haxejam ;:)~
t obad that we never will see your haxecode here

*lol :;)
ray?
pov?
?
you need to do all this -< reconfigs
for what have to run -> superstable into software then ?
(free or open BSD ?)
(or also?)
(not on mac i mean)
how often you are compiled your kernel since that time ?
ah .. i mean perl
(also .pl) ?
you are welcome
oh .. macintosh ?
are you from the `vi`-front ? (or emacs also?)
what linux do you are using and what is your wm ?
little bit _tricky_ ... but good _booting up_ into `vi` - ENV i mean
you should ask <@355347495976697867> also (we have `lua` now _available_ :;)
maybe thats what the microsoft-github-management now told as first:
"change the colors to make it more -> harmful" (or something 😂 )
(but my eyes sometimes ... really NotBilly *lol -> 🧑‍🦯 ;:)~
anyway .. most important is that it is -> `run`
😢
haxekungfu♥️
<@274214963026067457> what did you making you -> `experimenting` into haxe so much (^_^) ? *hugs
i ma like it
(also to use haxe crypto)
its some cool scripts into there
do you was looking into the bot-spam-submarine channel here last time ?
(wonder what is _intention_ there into)
haxebot also is good used the last days/weeks here i am gette feel
(thank you half *hugs ;:)
That looks ok now
oh ..
🙈
_horrible_
(my eyes wanna save my heart to get _Stopped_ by this -> color-combinate)
i am getting blind at now
woah ... igitt
<@151104106973495296> can you change that or is this discord-`global-setting` ?
All `keywords` now into
ugly for haxe ? ( at what point they was changing colors ?)
mhm... why since some months or so ... all the Disco-Syntax-HL here looks so
`c o d e`
`de` .. `en` .... no no no ->
`async` ... `await` ,,, ( 🙈 ) _ _ _  `a`sys
the _sad_ it is
(all others only `a`->wait ;:)

i am "REMEMBER"
if ai am "WAIT" ...
🤣

THE
IS
*LOL
WAITING
eh ... no no no ->
i mean (my f f f en)
a good `indrigient`
`cook` something for me ;:)
i only mean ...
into js-land it is also not possible to -> re use software
( to not make it a store for ANY spam ;:)
e.g. for secure _Sessionhandling_
i am was really looking into all of my old code for jobs into the past to look what we can use
what storing code also there! (and mapping it to a hashishvalue)
We really should code some little CGI on maitag
turbostone -> fun for YEARS!
game-jam-proto -> fun for a week or two
my old friend, write a good little haxelib (the extract ;:) ... is really fun and also helps you to sort things yourself
peote-ui + peote-text -> `to much optimized` i am would say at now (never again *lol !!! ;:)
(until no one need it optimized -> it still works slow but stable! :)
suer -> but also not really optimized per target!
(mhm.. can't find that old _scribble_ what explaining how it works byte-by-byte rfc)
<@694560611601743893> and then i am was need -> littleBigInt ;:)
ah..remember now -> after this i am was implementing a better `Remote` and data-syncing into there ... (by macro!)
(found only that stupid scribble here 🙈 at now)

yKnow .. its my old `joint`-protocol there (byte-wise to choose channel or to create a "virtual-like" server-channel)
but don'T know where ~_~
have some scribbles about there somewhere here on my disk
(really an -> optimization -> OVERKILL <- 🤣 )
absolute .. one byte for you and the other is me ;:)
so i am not sure someone other ever will using that out of us ;:)
all is 🍝 hardcoded into haxe-client/server peote-net protocol also
Half, only problem -> have no protocol-spec (fullyDoc) for ...
of P O E (`fullysyncy`)
🐅 - style
sure .. but not my old perl-5-style *LOL
(was much learned from the other haxe-freaks since that time!)
jo.. it -> changed
hey, np ... me get also much time deflected here into -> whateverthings
yeah
🚀
(wanna set up a new server there this year to have libc for haxe 4.1.5 at minimum! .. .then we can let run the "server"-instances directly at the 💓 _localhost_ there ;:)
how was going on into your latest tests by pure haxe js tryingout ?
i mean .. we also not painted so often .. but that think only -> redirects msg + keep on protocol of peote-net i mean
other node.js stuff would get -> mem-leaks or whatever into that time!
good old perlshit
YEAH 😂
hey -> even old multipaint-test server still running

peote.server (started for multipaint-test) also still running (^^)

what rule for ?
https://discord.com/channels/415681294446493696/436230004251164672/1078070758149992459
(nothing "lost" i mean \o/)
and all was there
ctrl - r
i changed my mind now (since own practice into my turbo-creating-workflow tonight)
but for _one browser session_ -...
was reading about into the past as it was new (my webbrowser here also clears all!)
jo
what save data into browser -> longtime-cache
Half, pls `extract` that out of turbostone (so code there also will be more readable!)
{but 4sure -> best to _share_ ;:)}
[would need some days at least to make it a stableworking little cgi-service i mean to!]
~ ~°)
(and not like to wanna code some perl-cgi + db... sqlite or something to store there and map all to _shortening-url-hash-param_ i mean
that needs more -> `space` ...
but i am already calculated that some of glsl-samples and also hscript stuff...
cos into lyapunow .. all of `formula` is fit into params of URL
therefor i am also need your knowledge into how to store things into the browser-store
.)
`sandboxtime`
then its ->
wait ... will have a _stable_ peote-ui texteditor sometimes
hey, but haxelime+peote -> runs allways stable !!!
🥲
!run ```haxe
-l hscript
var e = "var data = '
 _/_ @@@
[h[x]- @@ 
 /_   )@@@ 
 |@@@@@@
 @@@@ \\ \\'; 
return data;
";

trace(new hscript.Interp().execute(new hscript.Parser().parseString(e)));
```
my old haxebot-scripts also not _running_ anymore -_-
!run #4FA9a
!run #3d8ad
but not for what i am was original started into for myself!
yes, it is used now maybe for -> ANYTHING
... any my "pw"-protocol -> still not finished 😂
And now .->  good new lib to calculate with abitrary numbers ..
secret password transport protocol by myself (out of any "certificate"-oligopoles)
and so i am started a littleBigInt lib only to implement some day my own
so i am not wan'T to use https for (cos also was buggy into haxe:;) ...
and then there was the point where the user should -> "login" ...
Look at me .. some years ago i am was starting my old milkpiss-game-engine proto again ..
better a general-> little haxelib
Please make this another extra little lib please (wanna use this also somewhere else into my lyapunow-fractalgenerator later!)
cool is that all is there after refreshing webbrowserpage
jo
jo.. also undo-redo is need (into my peote-ui-UIText also!)
so the non-html-build of turbstone should save every minute later (configurabe!)
that no DATA gets lost if you started painting for some hours i mean
Half, but really --- > most IMPORTANT is ....
(not how to solve the pnp-algorithm i mean ;)
(how to make it looking cool ;:)
thousands _ideas_ going throught my grey-mass-of brain at now
we can also let them explode into pixels and then re-assembling-again
jo

<:haxe:567741748172816404>  < --- 2-point vec - transition ---> <:lime:567735656361492490>
... really not easy ;:) [non-logarithmic maybe ;:] \o/
mhm... but the resulting lime-line could be also more near to another line into the haxe-set
e.g. check every line into lime to one line into haxe (first step!)
how to find the nearest line-transitions ;:)
Its really a supercomplex `sorting` problem ...
(seems haxe-logo have 2 or some more)
.. the _rest_ of could generate randomly into outer screenspace.
or more simple at first ... if one of them have more line-count ...
(i need to split some lines if have not same amount!)
.. to make a little transition between the haxe and the lime logo :;)
... now i am think also its enough asset-testdata there ...
yeah .. no hurry
what need is -> zoom by mousewheel ( display.zoom = ... )
( before new features better only improving the user-interface and usabillyTy at First!)=
<@694560611601743893> the turbo-`grid` _feels_ more and more `haptic`

<@151104106973495296> new lime logo into assets ;:) -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/07a70578b26a6200ae5b7a7b481ce1ae2355721a>

also peote-ui ...was refactoring/improving all into parenting/masking by UIArea-widget ... so sample there also looks lesser spaghetticode ;:)
http://maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/TestUIArea/
(also the neko-http-async-loading-bug is fixed <:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218> )
yeah ... all peote-samples works smooth into new lime 8.0.1 release \o/
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition>
if you are using `gdisk` it takes two-byte type codes that expand out to the real type codes on the disk (e.g. `EF00` is a mnemonic for `C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B`-efi)
mhm, `Fdisk`
yes, can do that later (it have to check for node.js also then!)
you could try to convert the perl5 into haxe-code (async will be fun without POE-lib! ;:)
<https://metacpan.org/pod/pp>
PAR::Packer is the way for
you can make a windows executable of perl-server
you could try to host it somewhere into the cloud or something
perl server is only handle the peote-net-protocol and routing packages into optimized way
never tryed (openfl backend should work!)
(depends on haxe-ui backend)
don't know
https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/samples/assets/fonts/packed/unifont/unifont_3000-3fff.png?raw=true
peote-text can render glyphes for all languages
https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/samples/assets/fonts/packed/unifont/unifont_0000-0fff.png?raw=true
you can add them into font-config (if you mean for peote-text lib):
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/samples/assets/fonts/packed/unifont/config.json#L15>
(this is the only needed dependencies .. and perl5 for sure)
and for POE
yeah... than use CPAN there to install the perl-modules for websocket
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-server#perl-5-environment>
on linux its easy there to install and let it run
\o/ 💓
(uptime there is years at now ;:)
the peote-server on maitag also should still run
yeah
you can try also without a running peote-server by using `offline:true` like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-net-samples/blob/master/simple-test/Source/PeoteTest.hx#L33>
( did put the Main.hx also into "src" folder! )
this also builds now:
```-cp src
-lib peote-net
-main Main
-js bin/main.js
-D html5```
\o/
then a index.html and generated .js!
(for pure node.js or pure-haxe->js + index.html)
yes, pls make a new sample into `peote-net-samples`-repo so we did not tap into the same 🕳️ anymore later!
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-socket/tree/master/Source/jsCompat>
never tested on "node.js" also ... maybe there is need of another websocket-wrapper-aroundup then!
here <https://github.com/maitag/peote-socket/blob/master/Source/peote/socket/PeoteSocket.hx#L16>
into -> `#elseif js`!
yeah ... or change it ( + commit ... but before pls test all the samples ;:)
😂 (stupid error ... *lol)
try to build for `html5`
thats it is
cyrillic? do you mean for unicode-charset?
so therefor it can't found PeoteSocket type! (for what is your `target` inside of your .hxml)
there is only `#if html5` and not `#if js`
look at here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-socket/blob/master/Source/peote/socket/PeoteSocket.hx#L16>
<@694560611601743893> ah.. i am think i am know why there is a bug .,,,,,,,
<https://github.com/jobf/peote-net-experiment>
but half gets problem into build for: pure haxe -> js <- target (crazy error there!)
try out this sample: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-net-samples/tree/master/rpc>
yep
(or alternative you can use pure haxe-serialization or that of msgpack lib inside of peote-net-RPC)
but i am only using its _serializer_
hxbit can be used also as fully networking-solution
ah k
there is also `hxbit` ( peote-net RPC also can use the _serialization_-tools from this lib!)

i can tell you little bit modula5 if you wanna know |-|
eh.. if you really wanna `KNOW` -> learn perl 5 and 6 (or only 6 if you not have the time anymore!)
(you need that to -> build for `Any` ;)

thats only my littlehaxelimepeote-sample :;)

interesting
np also to look at the lisp code (thats really long ago 4m)
How your lisp-gl(e|w)ut sampleshader is looking like ?
hxsl is another cool tool!
there (sry)
so i am have to make that shitty-template-fuck
i am changing it at runtime
-> minimal as possible i am did there <-
```glsl
 gl_Position = vec4 (
   2.0 * zoom.x/width  * (pos.x + deltaX) - 1.0,
  -2.0 * zoom.y/height * (pos.y + deltaY) + 1.0,
  - ::ZINDEX::,
   1.0
 );        
```
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Shader.hx#L119>
here it is (my optimized calculation there into!)
(and `editable` at _funkyruntime_)
][]~*
pls. ignore the haxe-template-decoration ;) [that is only to make it work cross-gl  ;:)
(matrix only on need for low-dim)
i did my own `MINIMAL` matrixcalculation there
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Shader.hx>
hey .. maybe you can help me then to make my peote-v-tmpl shader -> also for triangle coords ?
me to
vertex for 2 or 3 dimensionfun?
(whereever it is)
cool
do you wanna learn glsl inside of "fragment" ? ( f(x,y) )
( 😂  ... some "fake" index-color-format experiment at runtime )
(you can then manually make a `=` to all -> _color-defines_ ;:)
to let you edit the glsl-fragmentshader there.
.. on top of a `text-edit` simple (transparent) thing
and therefor i am really thought -> how to inject peote-ui into bulby-samplecode ...
yeah.. was reading your msgs over the day here
glew/glu/glut are good
Why do you are learning lisp at now ? (was haskell not enough ;:)
git isn't good into _comparing_ binary
uKnow...
any... only wan't to get _updated_ whats was changed into image-data ... (i am hope half only changed the filenames ;:)
then hope that no one will set you out into wilderness sometimes!
(mhmh.. maybe this commit .. any <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/bf65004f8c1e6bff642a49f124c7853fb11e119d> )
lisp ... yeah -> b r a v e !!!
np (maybe half did that then)
(it didn't _build_ here ... may i am forgot to copy the asset-folder after last git-pull)
who was renaming the image - assets i mean 😅 ?
<@215582414544699393> was this last state into sample where using your pixelart ?
🌊 🌋
take care 🖖
hey.. nice to talk to you everytime
me need to generate sometimes SND by GPU .. really!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjT0VVvP4Q4
*lol
was <@428585647117303808> into the past also -> atari-user ... ~^~ ^^^ ? ~_~
mhmmm... i am really wanna know now ...
that was the best later on Amiga (but also c64 modtrackers was the best before!!!)
yeah .. \o/ .. that one i am also wrote some songs into
tz tz
was using cubase only later sometimes on PC
(was both good computers at that time!)
^^
ah
oh ...really .. you was an old atari-user?
(in depend of length and angle ;:)
you can make the turbolines -> play sound also!
important is that there is no "lag" ... between sound-sample and graphic-animation!
or do both ... into blender you really can simmulate 3d-soundwave-> ... (how it is going throught room and reflected  recursively by surfaces )
or build music-instrument
learn more into blender then!
the better it will be
into the more gamejams you are using it
hey, maybe some day you or some otherone will build on turbostone-editor on top
🎪
*LOL
camel-pipeline
🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪 🐫 🐪
😂
hey.. all no problem ;:)
(even haxe can not build itself inside of haxe language)
only mean that at now its hard to integrate the editor itself
to let edit the graphic assets at runtime!
it can be peote-ui -> widget!
hey
(can be integrated directly inside future-games i mean!=)
for -> `Editor`
i mean your haxe-code-PLAN
but only the fileformat
sure
then -> new lib on top of what using the base-one!
and if need more (for a nextJam)
Make it more universal to use
and not more!
game-> DATA
(and the json2obj schemes above have to be -> synced by lib!)
there at now
oh.. and we also only have `decode`
(^_^)
-> from deeper parts of my brain )
(have to make "fire" that -> bubble up event
(sry.. was to much into peote-text & ui last days)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/TurboData.hx#L22>
last time i did the regexp into
ah.. i am remember ...
together with you and nanji (was he also edited something there =? .. was late at night .. not much remembering ;:)
last times i am really tryed to `encapsulate` into TurboData-silicate
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src>
we have -> redundant json2object - class-defines
wanna also use -> `turbostone` lib
me also dont wanna ... e.g. i am also using tools like json2obj and other spice ...(<:lime:567735656361492490>)
no no .. it have to `fit` more to your `game`
not that every "dungeon" looking the same at the end i mean
...
thats what i am prefare
lvl-graph
for myself i am more like to make my own algorithms there into
i know
ah
and .. was it working ?=
aah... y .. remember that you are used this lib... (sry)
show me here into haxebot
~~
what we was talking about,
or do you integrated the maze-generator into last jam ?
problem
or _thinking_ about algorithm
for peote-text its -> impossible
installation -> how to use ....
i think best idea (for my workflow) is to write more into readmes
(dox is ok!)
html into general for me
(don'T like also to writa dox-tmpl)
who the hell will write the documentation for .. e.g. input2action or peote-text/ui ???
i am only think sometimes ...

can be easy -> `colored` 🎨
all what is `grey` into ui-samples and stuff ...
so after text-editor for NPC-hscript is running good,
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/gradientspitko/
and more peote-ui-styles ... like gradiants into...
jo.. lemme more focus on the crazy stuff (like to let text "glow" and such nice things!)
so best then -> not traversing the AST at any keypress (or the trisitter-graph)
and will be a good performance test also for peote-text stylechanging-features!
(dont wanna have autocomplete or something there!)
its only highlighning .. can be slow and into background->thread °
💋
yeah .. pls stop me then (remember me into that i am have to make it quick and dirty by regexps)
pls stop me there then if time is comming *hugs
-> int tokentreesitterBESTapproach
The only help into this year and for "TextEditor" i am think is
<@694560611601743893> if i am _working_ on my _peotelibs_ ;:)
Its not like "at work" for me.
with my libtools at now also!
I am like to write little -> TextEditor <- by myself
Not to much at now ( code have to keep readable )
also some day -> "wordwrapping"
that all at the end there into code!
the single text-edit line widgets works 100% bugfree!
( i did not put into all the keyboard-commands into yet... will do next days same as into `UITextPage` widget)
oh, only `UITextLine` then ?
feel free to use it (even if the "ui" there is also still into build-phase)
`faster` for `creation`
( feels cool {[like into blender but more simple minimalized]} )
( i am like the "grid"-level thing !!! )
your cool thing also was gimme much inspirations!!!!
to make -> cross-operable to nanjispice
i can help maybe into -> `TextureData`-Interfacing
yeah, but then your lib is depend also on good old friend <@371312079526952960> (maybe not sure all peote-targets will work then stable ^~)
no no .. at first "turbostone" have to be a good haxelib!
not yet!
And .. sorry Half, but my mind also was going further and i am thought about -> how to fill the `space` between the lines into `COLOR` ;:)
more to make the 1-point lines -> good aliased by simple-shader only!
line-thickness-problem ....
what me thought about last times ... was not so much about the
yeah ... make also a turbo-clean into turbostone-cool editor!
(and to _Stabilize_!)
to make it better to build up on!
but then i am was take a little nap .. and rewrote all
Last night i am was not far away to make all -> boilerplate into code there ...
(wanna not do to much before all other things is well)
yeah .. all into "scrolling" is not implemented at now

( moment .. will make that looking better ;:) ...
Half, here the haxe-logo 😂 ->
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/edit-spinoza/
moment .. will rebuild the "largeText"-sample 😂 ....
no more "critical" at now! (puh.. that was really greatest mess here into since years!)
at least there is 2 bad hidden ones into textediting (deep into `peote-text` underlib)
+ simple syntax-highlightning (hx, glsl, json)
and then -> undo/redo (ringbuffer!)
now only -> bugfixing
🌊
\o/
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/input2action/InputTextPage.hx#L15>
sooo... i am think now the most keyboard-commands for a (some day <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> ) new code-EDITOR is ready:
(is github to slow i mean=?)
better would be an own hosted build-server ?
ooh
what is that about ?
yep ;:)

cuddling out of me into _fractalspace_
eh daisy ... i mean what prexot last time did

🪢
together with that `ugly` mandelbulb
for my old _lyapunov proceduralchilds_

\o/ -> yeah .. new "monster" was borrn
lets look how it interpolates at first (into "resolution")

(to use my old .blend patch it is need old build!)

(1 min)
(sry ... -> need to start my old blender fractal to find real rnd)

<@215582414544699393> do you tryed out the "bulby"-code also (not changed the `holy code` i mean!)
[{( <@829815425234632765> i am think would not be into the `asset` <-> `code` bridge anymore tonight)}]
or do you wanna see what i am can do into peote space (what only can <@694560611601743893> see throught his 🕶️ ?)
lemme render a little fractal for you , daisy and all my old coderfriends here
anyway (need relax! )
y .. better _diff_ your srcode
`` quadN`
or
`triangle`
Not that at the end you wanna have a
(not that we wanna end here into like discussion at now i am had sometimes together with <@371312079526952960> 🥷 )
or what you wanna tell me about glsl `var` ying between vertex and fragment ?
are you a `uniform`
do you tell this to me directly at now ? (should i am render fractal \o/ fU=?`=`?`=?)

so what is you funAtNight?
(where nobody out of you can help into change it)
to try that what you wanna do into browser->canvas
i am know ... discord haxebot here is really little castrated into that
<@215582414544699393> really wonder why you are not using this to feed the web browsers `CANVAS` tonight
apropos "canvas" -> <https://try.haxe.org/#8777d11e> (found that again into filefolderwildernesslabyrintOfmyComputerHereAtNOW)

i am personally like all into haxe (only have not time to test out them all)
ciao ciao ~
"brb" have to be `keyword` insideOf <@688713768938897420> s new `interpretor` tool

whats that ?

the -> `generative` and
i mean: do you `like` things like that ?
do you more like suchlike things ?
the -> level-generator ...
is the old problem of Half into last game-jam ...
into haxebot here also
what could be "solved"
what me allways is into mind
`chat` &| `codingflow` ^^?
you know ...
pls gimme an -> afk <- then the next time!
maybe i am can forgot for tonight to `code something into haxe` with you tonight!
<@829815425234632765> /u are `laggy` into -> _chatcommunication_ i mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMRpm7ycanU
(or do you on mobile-phone and out of keyboard?)
🧠 <- STD-IN (^^)
i am `open for`
but your `pure` haxe code
oh, for haxe-ui i am to much `fuzzy`-random into brain tonight
<@829815425234632765> https://youtu.be/lxZpEFJhO6k?t=1061
do you know `tink_cli` ?
\o/
`lime` is have the good supercowpowertools what i am neeed ;:)
(i am still into haxelime.)
So .. all have its -> charme
(especially into 3d by blender-armory-combination!)
what gives all kind of access to the most op-systems into the wildness
thats also a beautypowerfully ....
or do you more the stdio-type ?
Daisy, do you also tryed out "KHA" sometimes ? (the other 3. great framework what using haxe-pure ;:)
its same as heaps (but more ways to do it!)
(it was out of "openfl"-repo for a time -> but now already includet into <:openfl:567735656017821708> )
[ so for a _little moment_ it maybe was `free` 😆  ]
its the `base`-softwarelayer of openfl
<https://github.com/openfl/lime/>
🕸️
+ peote 😂 ?
wanna learn haxelime ?
<@829815425234632765> whats your plan into haxe for the next time ?
anyway.. not sure there is much options at gnu-compiler for ram-management either
.. what last time was spoken about)
(like with that "continue-ram-adress-space"-thing...
but maybe sometimes into -> RAM-usage
also some FPU-optimizations not matters
if only "graphic"-rendering is the bottleneck
i ve often read that someones doing this!
( g++ maybe :)
sure
...thats cool tools here ;:)
it never _breaked_ my code before i mean
(same for haxe)
i need 1-3 day maybe to _migrate_
so if new lime version comes ...
my goal is to finalize my stuff here over time (but to keep also all `interoperable` into _fastFutureChangings_)
i am can not _concentrate_ at -> `Any`
or by drawing-pen-tools from <@371312079526952960>
-> it also will work in <:openfl:567735656017821708> <:flixel:230369617774641152>
at some day ... 🙈 (i am hope ...
i am only hope
🌅 🪢
(i am only using into neko here!)
😂
it tell it all!
-> alone the name
`turbo`-stone
i am think
really
or hl->C versus hxcpp (+gcc-extraoptimizationflags :;)
or hashlink-vm
js->v9 ?
what is faster maybe ?
but now ...
love it!
so therefore i am using also this triangle of set
( js-browser-target much helped me into async and also GL-stuff into the past often! )
yeah .. js also gives you the third handshake!
(where neko than _crashes_ directly into _nimbus_)
hashlink gimme more hints if there is something into `null`-safity of newest compilerfeatures!
and on other side
-> neko gimme better feedback into!
i mean: if hashlink only gimme: `Invalid_argument("List.map2")`
into some `haxe-compiler` trickyness i mean!
(before code gets to complex there i mean!)
Without "neko" i am also would not see some _hidden_ errors that inside of "hashlink" maybe only appears if its to late
hxcpp, neko, hashlink ... and so on! ;-)-> C
i am like them all
yeah.. i am thougt/think maybe more important there is 
stability and production-timestamp
ahh.. thank you Half <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
( 🙈 i am only hope its not cos of "gc" ~ ~ ~ .. oh oh)
or cos of _compatibility_ ?
i am only interested why not using ... maybe -> buildtime ?
not only ...
🙂 to -> reduce _complexity_ ?
<@151104106973495296> but why heaps not using hxcpp ? is it have no usecase for and to make all more _simple_ into -> production for ?
(i am remember there was a _Trunk_ sometimes and things was already _working_ ... but to long ago and not sure who is using and keep it up to date nowadays)
to get output of -> WASM <- again
what i am would wish for christmas or any into lime would be...
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/project.xml#L51>
(last time i am tested into peote all was running .. not sure it was faster)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGLE_(software)>
(but WHO using "angle" nowadays *LOL ;:)
`lime` also can do `Angle` on windows! (only 1 line into project config is need!)
`haxelime` also have a some simmiliar pure filechange-watcher-tool (not as fast as hashlinks new one but for me even this is to much ;:)

yeah .. also another Krücke
you see the `effect` immeadely
if you change one char into codeline
the `ideal`-thing what all wanna have (was much hype also around but thats an old technique!)
(only some parts!)
(or more into granulat!)
(like: changing a linked lib at c-runtime)
while the program is still running!
to also load only the code what was changed
or abilities (depend on system!)
that only means ("that just in time") -> not have to build all again
what .. why that ?
😂
no ;:)
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/turbostone/>
look at what Half, NotBilly and me did last days:
Daisy, if you ever trying out `pure` lime and peote ...
(should work at best together i mean!)
heaps and hashlink is really good friends into environment i mean
<@829815425234632765> do you using heaps ?
`playstate` \o/

you should make the API or fileformat now ->

Wanna also not look into code of `turbostone` EDITOR
;:)
-> works <-
🌉
`interoparable`
(any -> if json2object <- is our
also
but have to clean to much into my own
would clean your own code
(then you not have to think about it until it runs into background! [turbostone json-read/write-code need to share!] )
hey, you can make it a -> `lib` later !
`?`?`???`?`? `?``?
cos my 🍝 .... 0_0
Bulby ... and js for me is not really as for _relaxing_ at now you know 4me
really wanna code some s i m p l e haxelimepeotedemo at now (but seems <@694560611601743893> have no time tonight 😭)

was writing a sample some times ago: <https://github.com/maitag/lime-samples/tree/master/features/file-io/filedialog>
(wonder how it will look on i3-wm)
remember that most problems into the past there was most into unicode of filenames (hl)
ah ok (maybe its still fixed then)
oh, issues there?
<https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/develop/src/lime/ui/FileDialog.hx>
lime have some!
np (will use the hashlink version later!)
(my browser also clears all cache data everytime i am restart it)
jo.. but was forgot that
ok (was also confusing little bit ... "save" means .> save for me ;)
ah, is this need befor export ?
oh, maybe was problem by saving ?
(all easy also cos of json2obj)
yeah, no hurry!
"single model" is not need (it should read the first frame then only!)
aahhh ... will try to extract this by regexp next time!

<@231872730478280705> sorry.. lemm render _little_ fractal 4u=?
(springtime is _near_:;:)
any -> lets make it `run`
<@151104106973495296> maybe <@694560611601743893> only
( half or nanji never would get brave enough to create a new folder there ~_ ~)=
"art"-folder was need.
<@151104106973495296> my code-repo is your one the same
<@151104106973495296> sorry .. not wanna tell you to much about my own -> c o d e ;)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB1yUXBzUjA
<@694560611601743893> lets keep an eye on -> animation!
(if we wanna have to render -> more that one;)
<@151104106973495296> any my goal is to make -> 4 bytes only <- per `turbostone` line
<@694560611601743893> is the one who did -> `ART`-little `editor` here
(out or "art" i mean ;:) -> c o d e  _into_
<@151104106973495296> or should we -> _finish_ that REALLY ^ ^ ?
with my old(/new;) fractal-settings ...
and better will find something again to _render_ over _sleepingTime_
anyway.. i am will close all my code-editors for now ( <@151104106973495296> sry... my last commit contains errors ;)
-> to ->>>> re - use ;:) ]}
( and ... really into hope ...
`store`
to
4004 bytes
if you edit -> 1001 lines
2 bytes per point  -> 4 bytes per line
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineCPU/src/LineSegment.hx#L9>
into peote there i am only using short-int
text-format only for > `debugg
line
per
2 points
( -> best -> `binary` format!!! )
<@694560611601743893> every `turbo` line have 16 bit --- SHORT integer only
( .. of -> S V G ... or something what need "pre" -> defines )
( i am not wanna know what will be happen if there is <@371312079526952960> s XML there some day into -> parsing-error ;:)
<@151104106973495296> i am will not `touch` that code there before you or <@694560611601743893> will not fixing that please ;)
(hey .. we should migrate all samples there to json2obj)
that can only mean that there is something wrong into -> JAYSON
``Called from NotBillysFirst.hx line 62
Uncaught exception - Invalid field access : length``
( <@151104106973495296> really have no idea why not working at now ...                😭 )
before it goes into `animation ` you know -> the  `still images` need to `generate`
but we also need more abstraction about turboline-loop there ! (to load all them into at once i mean!)
there is error (json-parsing?)

and that the only one who `ever` can remove or `mv´ it again
(^_^)* hugs
<@151104106973495296> i am hope you know that your new folder there will be -> forever ;)
(where all samples can _took_ from)
(now we have a `sharing` asset-folder!)
♥️
<@151104106973495296> that good idea only can be by you
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines>
new "art" folder \o/
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits/master/lines>
is -> `IN`
yeah.. see it now (i am thought you tell me .. moment)

where is @gamma11 ?
by the way
<:surprised_pikachu:698898655410782218>
(and sorry if your sample then is together with lineGPU and lineCPU into one folder [have to `compress` that sometimes or not)
(pls name it like you want ! ;:)
i am will `merge` instant

gimme pull request into new folder here:

all is `welcome` (pls put into our -> asset folder _sharing_ shitty thing there s... moment .....
(maybe not `brave` enought cos of `time`-set)
and not wanna do -> `extravagand`
And i am THINK its it only cos -> wanna let look the game like the other games into <:flixel:230369617774641152> - `playstate`
i mean for -> graphic-asset-creation -> O N L Y
<@151104106973495296> i am really wonder why my old friend <@694560611601743893> not was using into latest -> JAM
(all is still into half-dev-time)
try the -> `gamma` version
(_samplespacespice_)
also invited to use your turbo-lines inside of my peote-engine
sry .. NotNBilly .. you are for sure
wanna `replace` -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/Main.hx#L51>
!!!! !!!
pls send me json-code of"
here is my usecase-sample: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone>
hosted onto other severs ( i am only looking at -> gamma .. eplsylon ... and followings there into)
<@151104106973495296> maybe half have a more new version
(bookmark place on desktop here at the corners ;)
http://maitag.de/~half/2023/turbo-stone/
(also how _fast_ that little tool was created 🫂 )
thats really _fascinating_ me!
10 seconds to create (and all is -> animation ready <- \o/)

into haxe-tools for something new into minimalistic graphics tool (out of all that "pixels" i mean)
<@151104106973495296> the best i am was seen last times was halfs crazyfreaky (well-thinked & implemented) `turbostone`
🌌
[and _disconnecting the cam&phone here_ 😂 ]
take care (also will leaving the "voice"-channel at now ;:)
the simple the basecode is -> the better ⚓ hooks at _ground_ again
💯 sure into NME (more easy as would be into OpenFL)
make it -> ``runagain`> and again!
even if my 10 years ago samples is looking -> OLD
i can  am
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxenme/>
maybe .. i am have my own super old one where i am would start into:
(if no unit-testing can be implement easy for graphics-ui-stuff)
at least needs a _Sample_
i am allways need to have a simple -> `usecase` also
-> who creates at what point into source
the first ones is also -> asking directly
if i am get problem into openfl...
ask the creator!
where i am get "allow"-acces into .. what do you mean into detail ?
( i am long time not tested my things there .. should work at all! )
for nme
ask hugh
E
V
A
S
is
all game-> `state`
( multiuser->backup-store)
`git` is _saving_ all for us

no hurry please

<@385939141981896705> ... its was finished ... (after 13h)
by the way ...
or render by blender -> fractalstuff
([{atNow}])
([can only make _starters])
(ui-textedit was to much last time here ... need :aid: )
(my shitty bag ,,, only wanna press the `merge` button tonight)
( -> tonight [or i am will get bad dreams :;])
( -> have to be -> supereadable!)
(not until we not finish the starter for sure!)
we have a new folder and starter-kit at now ;)
for more fun with nanjitools
anyway ,,. ,,,.
ah
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/pixelimage/_starter/src/Main.hx#L100>
( only for <@371312079526952960> s `tools` )
sorry .. was need to create a new folder 😅
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/pixelimage>
ok, its into 📬
moment .. i am will `upload`

😂
on
so
and
^^ ...
`z=f(x,y)`
step2:
`y=f(x)`
step 1:
microlazerprecision
and -> _vectorized_
(then we make it -> pixel again <- ,,, and finally using it to make an _haxeabstract up and downcast_ ;:)
<@371312079526952960> can you please generate the ascii-out of wttr into some beautiful looking shapes please (^_^) !
can not really see the `moon`
```sh
semmi@lem:~$ curl wttr.in/rostock
Weather report: rostock

                Overcast

                0.0 mm
```
try it by `curl wttr.in/leeds`

(to parse into `peote-text` ready2render-styles -> out of the box)
but seems like that the "http"-version there only gimme that shitty XML to parse

Was also trying wttr.in today to use as sample for new "http"-folder into our playground
(and the input at the bottom *LOL ;:)
i am have to put the generate button at the top (also the generated image-texture-OUT)
and cos the text-field "scroll"-area is still buggy

and only pointer-over, -out and -up events for.
-> needa "roundBoxStyle" for
(was to long of time into `peote-text` again)
Anyway ... have to make some ui-button .... i am totally forgot how it was into 🙈 ...
so if you sometimes need -> only tell me!
non-pixelated->supersmoooth also! ;:)*hugs

(ive bookmarked link here on desktop .. cant find anymore *lol 🙈 )

sometimes into rroundUP also give some shadercode we can be using also

now only a "generate" button 😅

still started ... ("pixelimage"-folder into ;:)
<@371312079526952960> have to create a new _folder_ into peote-sample for ... what name do you prefare ... "pixelimage" ... (or maybe some general "texture" category at first?)
mhm, maybe it can be converted directly from/to UInt32Array also without a loop
(and argb to rgba then by opengl/shader) ... will check this next time i am into texture/texturedata again
( shit ... old blender version -> was pressing F12 again 🙈 )
(mhm.. should render my ..*lol -> bossfractalmonster maybe anotherday)

yeah Grizzle, a little offset sometimes reallyhelps

aha
(cos of "frame"...into namespace)

someone asking for help into main-channel
oh .. moment (5 min)
(4me personallyplease)
inheritance have to be -> recursive!
(into trust about that it is working ;:)
that only u know ...
i am only wanna #include
(what should the young haxecoders here think about ... and us ;:) =?
that not looks -> good dancing code
i mean
TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withStringTriangleGML.withStringTriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withStringTriangleGML.withString TriangleGML.withString
(or do you was for a to long of time=(?=)=?
👨‍🏭 r
are you -> `machinist` @nanji `?
fully -> REDUNDANT code
(out of day ;:) -> y can't believe:;~~~° ° _Ö:_
haxe `switch` is really -> so much (for me personally)
("switch" is also haxes -> most not touched tool)
lets switch the theme
we should wait into that to let discuss it with my old friend Ian into round also!
you need `core` libs!
<@371312079526952960> `==` <@385014891750096896>
finish that thing!
you are better _nested_ into the Flixel-Community with your lib i am think!
(ok, would be also fun to haxe 1001 format-bountybrances into space ... ;:)
haxe format lib is the starting point!
put also your own format into there!
yeah
make it -> compatible at simple!
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/format> <- 🤿
haxe already have format lib by nico
i am thought most of is only js (triliteralAlsoMigratedNow?)
any on neko or what .. your lib is running there ? (do you using the 🫀 haxe-tools?)
[is there a disco-chan?]
perl -> 6 ;:)
nanji ..come one... lets learn something new ;)
(php is shit)
-> learn perl!
and only a point is invisible
the world is also -> lines
what one =?
why you not using also Flixel for your graphic-lib <@371312079526952960> i mean ?=
<@694560611601743893> told me today: flixel is faster 4 game proto ~~
so all the game-jam-freaks can using it!
with your -> graphics-api
you should better concentrate on -> Flixel <-
(i mean .> its only _computercode_!!!)
(lesser code then to write)
but i am like to do a simple haxe abstract cast
why not
?
🌉
i mean for good stagble
or -> `shape` nowadaysNEW ?
is your Format ?
-> pixelimage <-
you are also using lime ?
what ?
there!
@:from
no no ... let me do that by
```haxe
@:forward
abstract TextureData(TextureDataImpl) to TextureDataImpl 
{
    inline public function new(width:Int, height:Int, type:TextureType = TextureType.UINT, data:UInt8Array = null) {
        this = new TextureDataImpl(width, height, type, data);
    }
    
    
    @:from
    static public function fromLimeImage(image:lime.graphics.Image) {
        return new TextureData(image.width, image.height, TextureType.UINT,
            UInt8Array.fromBytes( image.data.toBytes() )
        );
    }

    //@:to
    //public function toLimeImage() {
        //return ;
    //}
    
}```
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L44>
<:lime:567735656361492490>
will handle your image-data same as the ones from
`var textureData = toPeoteTextureData( pixelImage );`
no extra `var` is need
can -> understand.
some haxefriends here ... you know ?)
that i am wonder who into world (out of you and maybe
cos your code looks so much complex
make that fix then
int -> o
i am trusting you also a little bit int you know!
if it not works -> np!
<@371312079526952960> wanna only have some fun with your libs u kno ?w
of -> `anything`
and -> no `return`
🌅
(with _realSand_ :;)
can make a `sanbox`-testing-thing for you!
( have no treesitter-support at now but any )
hey, lets us test then with my new ui-support
(for half into lines .. for me u know only -> pixel at now ;:)
it worked already
(have also not the time to write my own wrapper)
what not will change over the next 20 years ;)
need strict API
or work together with me (any half also using from time to time maybe)
do your own thing
(as y know)
(only getting stuck into SVG)
sure
(out if me and half i mean)
your stuff!
sing
i mean that some one other also  u   uuu  uuu uuuuuuuuuuuu
that you forgot what all is around on you!
is your mind at now!
only tris
you are focussed so long now only into triangles
your middel-brain!
thats not what i am was mean
(to make -> recursion)
i mean how much time it is need to calculate the `middle` point of a triangle
<@371312079526952960> how do you split a triangle-surface into other triangle surfaces (subdivisionlike)?
so no longer "Browser"-junk dependencies to use into ?
yeah .. only _graphically way to use haxe_

idea is to make sample for any -> gpt ,,, microsoft-new-gpt ... other into ai-bublehuble
(we have good prototype now to build up on!)
♥️ 🏹
(you are the -> second one!)
(no one out of half here ever testing my libs)
Furret, let me hug y4a short moment
the results!
and into lower textfield of ui-system it will print out

to send to
what using the input of the 2 text-in shit
i am now have to make it ready  by a `button`
(totally haxecross also!)
now you have 3 ui widgets there .. do you see ?
🥷
(some can be -> en/disable <- ... not really _polished_ at all)

me will als try to write a readme for you
is enough!
simple `> lime test neko`
and then
haxe lib install git -> peote (can write you into readme there !)
np -> pure lime
(i am really hate html-ui u know .. all what is -> xml also!)
oh.. i am forgot the "send" button ;:)
mhm.. lemme think .. prototype is there at now (<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/http/_starter/src/Main.hx>)
pls hook it into my ui-code pls
(i am know the artist who did such things by the way [really!:;)[[]}})
lemme run also from your latest changes!
and being faster at end ;:)
then i am can also hack my code directly into haxebot here

<@456226577798135808> what kind of "handler" you need to 🪢 your lib on ?
(1 min!)
(sory.. code was need to clean up a little!)

have it now:
(sorry.. 10 min please!)
(sry.. have to clean my haxe-code before uploading -> 15 min!)

AnyWay .. lemme try to use my own lib into only half of an our

i am gettint a _short_ -> `flashback`moment
( <@151104106973495296> i am remember you send me this also some years ago )
only have to wait until NBs music is over
ok, let me try .... (hope i am not need more than 1/2 hour for ui-proto!)
or should i am better do something of the other whas is into my mind to implement iside of haxe-LANG
(missing some _Feedback_ by you)
<@456226577798135808> i mean .. is it ok then to make that ui-proto ? (+token-input) ?
<@456226577798135808> ... sorry, not wanna stress you .. but is it ok if i am wanna make sample for you into my haxe->graphicshitOnly ?
*waiting ...

i am only using the `LTS` versions from half-heart
<http://maitag.de/~half/2023/turbo-stone/>
wait until we can make stick-fight-assets there into (and simple using into peote!)
( i am not wanna -> make game-only <- u know)
peote is more for demoscene!
yes (therefor all the games there also is looking the same everytime ;:)

do you need a token -> INPUT userface-element ?
sorry: haxelib into developement
(and deepl i mean i am also can use by web-browser without any token-access!)
mhm... but <@456226577798135808> lib-prototype only needs token, input and output (much more simple!)(
pure haxeJS\o/
playtime! (why only half here is understanding me=?)
haxe-ui backend for peote-lib-tree ?
n e k o alsoShouldWork!
mhm.. i am only wanna make the -> UI <- (cos that is into my mind at now at 100%)
<@151104106973495296> how would that look for .. e.g. `deepl` - http-service ? ...
is it need more ui-input elements or "buttons" to make a simpleSampleFor also ?
( peote-`playstore` ;:)
<@456226577798135808> will put it together with the samples from <@694560611601743893> and <@371312079526952960> then into here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples>
(the "token"-input is only into _developing phase_ for sure ;:)
would that be enough to "test" out ?

Furretuwu ... this i could make into 1/2h for -> ui-startet-test ....
this looks discordspecific inside of your proto
`r.addHeader("User-Agent", "hxopenai (https://github.com/FurretDev/hxdiscord)");`
(or should i write _starter one at now 😍 ?)
and i am will use it also into little samples !
-> gimme also little haxe-> A P I
ah coool!
(what is that for ?)

please 🫂 ... is it what you are actually working on ?
(there i am can help .. thats also the tinkerbell lib where i am have practice into!)
can be alsO easy to use by tink_cli IO sample then!
yeah .. gimme a nice little lib (not need "features"!) i am can using into my text-render/edit-samples
or wanna wait as long as tink_http waits for `asys` new haxe-api
only asking ... not wanna follow the wrong `path` into _wilderness_ i mean (^_^)
there is `dead links` inside
🐛
(to get happy again ;:)
(me only need -> simple peote-wrapped haxelimeGL ;:)
flixel is ok (but i am would feel to old there into some things .)
thats 14 years ago now!
(to much shitty non-funny-coding last night+day into UI again 😭 )

before i am get
i mean -> need some fun
ah.. shitty deepl-translation
(my graphics-stuff also works the same on neko .. you can use also for testing then!)
and -> works !
(ok... also getting a "key" is some effort then for me! ;:)
haxelib install git ... -> `your` lib
and then best would be 😅 ->
Wanna make 2 text-widgets into my ui-code ... one for INPUT and the other for GPT->OUT
(also without html-ui)
... where i am can "ask the gpt" without to have twitter or something
Furretuwu, i am only wanna try out some "new stuff" to not get totally depressed with my text-rendering and ui and all there .... need some -> SIMPLE <- funny sample there...
or also into the js-socketwrapping there ?
Is it only for the native targets what is doing `http/s` by simple socket ?
to give that "main"-issue more -> `priority`
we should post here: https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/1042094196238065755
jo
?
where is it into "issues" there
(before haxe-asys ;:)
that should be fixed!
🩸
what .. the haxe http-blocking-bug ?
ok, then give it a try by tinkterbell (but i am think this should be also fixed sometimes directly into haxe-http-core then!)
are you 100% its not the new "anticheating"-protectionshit from open-ai only ?
would it maybe better to only use the "official" libs from open-ai and only writing (generate) the haxe-externals for js and cpp ?
or look at this: <https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT> !
do you also looked into js-land ? (was searching today ... there is much only working unstable they wrote ... e.g. <https://github.com/abacaj/unofficial-chatgpt-api>)
sure i am mean your lib ....
<@456226577798135808> i am think i know now why your chatgpt socket code was blocking last time (it needs session-handling or somethink maybe) .. do you are still working on ?
found this today: <https://github.com/Mix-Anik/chatgpt-lib> to have some simple js-tool to test into my text-edit-field ... but there is written that they have "antispam"-blockers now .... wtfh
mhm, is there no other alternative to "pseydo"-open-ai .... ? ? .....
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VjMOkW7qpo
and the parts where the player can walk throught is rendered on top tile-by-tile
So all walls is only a great "background" with a earth/sand texture
so its not the "walls" what will be render tile-by-tile ... its the "holes" what allways -> extending
or the vice-versa way i am also think would be interesting e.g. for games where the terrain can be to dig throught ....

What i am sometimes think about is how to make such terrain-mapping also to look randomly and to round up corners
interesting!
ah, i see .... its how to connect the "tiles" together
whats the "47"-fully-autotiling ?
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/SimpleText/
any, it goes further and can do also "selection" inside text-page at now:

woah , my text-edit-thing is still buggy at some points 😢 ....
`blocking` i mean
haxe have no problem into

oh, thats for 2d also ?
( + some 2 line text-description like: "You are inside a roughtly dungeone and heare the cracky voice of breaking stones" ... or something 😂 !)
so i am sure it can also generate some simple 2d-room level
my old son here told me, that he was playing "mud" inside of gpt3 already!
Is someone here have gpt3-account to test that out please 😂 ?
or: "chatgpt, pls gimme a random seed for my maze-generator to username: semmi" *lol
and question to chatGPT: "gimme a ascii maze" !
chat-gpt ( <@456226577798135808> s lib! ) -.--...--
i am would try
(cos the algorithm behind is not that _Trivial_ as it seems to generate good playable algorithms)
yes, or do only copy paste code into haxe-language
into internet!
Faster you are if you search
but don't asl me half ... i am would need a day or so...
yeah -> think recursive!
and maybe repeating this _procedure_ one or 2 times again!
make another little MAZE inside of ...
then for NOT every room inside (so randomly choosed!) ....
on maze at uppest level -> 5x5 or so
e.g.
to make it for your usecase you have to modify!
(oh.. haxebot is _sleeping_)
!run ```haxe
//----------------------
// GIMME MAZE MEME (^_^)
//----------------------
var genMazeSimple = null;
genMazeSimple = function(m,x,y,w,h) {
  m[y][x] = ' ';
  var d=[-2,0,0,2,2,0,0,-2];
  while(d.length>0) {
    var i=d.splice(2*Math.floor(Math.random()*d.length/2),2);
    var a=x+i[0];
    var b=y+i[1];
    if(a>0 && b>0 && a<w && b<h && m[b][a]!=' ') {
      m[b-Math.floor(i[1]/2)][a-Math.floor(i[0]/2)] = ' ';
      genMazeSimple(m,a,b,w,h);
    }
  }
}
var w = 13;
var h = 5;
var maze = [];
for (y in 0...h) {
  maze[y] = [];
  for (x in 0...w) {maze[y].push('#');}
}
genMazeSimple(maze,1,1,w,h);
trace('Maze MEME:');
for (y in 0...h) {trace( ((y<9) ? " " : '') + maze[y].join('') );}
```
you need to make it recursive then
you can use my old haxe-console->try-haxe->haxebot one if you wanna
ah, so you have good maze-algorithm for already ?
Flixel is really easy to read !
y y .. i am understanding the code more and more
aha
ah, so a "Floor" is _connecting_ the "Rooms" ? (<https://github.com/jobf/haxejam-2023-winter/blob/master/source/engine/map/Data.hx>)
yeah, the graphic isnt also focus there!
oh, so no peote-view this time 😅 ?
perfect 💯
how do you design the map .. is all inside a grid arranged or is e.g. the wall-hit-test by echo or something ?
jooooo
wow, looks good!
Half, what do you do into haxe-jam this time ?
any -> it goes on \o/ (that keeps me _motivated_)
yeah ... me need a little fuzzy-break cos of to-much-spaghetti inside of peote-ui last days here
me to (its the `coldness` over europe what also did make my bag ache)
i am also feel little bit tired to get that openai-testingkey and such
then better other time (tell me!)
ok
(or a whole gameintro-story 😂 !)
I can also well imagine that it would be very funny to use into game-JAM 🙂 ...
e.g. to let write chatgpt some greeting message after the player put into its name or something!
<@456226577798135808> how is your _roadmap_ into this for lib-usage ?
<@694560611601743893> Are you up for something like that? It's certainly fun to see what else you can do with it (but first a starter example must run!)
or all into -> `json2object` .... hmmm?
(ups 🙈 ..sorry str!)
oh, and would it be better/possible to make the typedefs into <@456226577798135808>uctinit class
and later more widget to play around with the options ( e.g. what is that "image" for ?)
so into ui-sample i can only have 1 input-line and 1 output text-field at first...
mhm... Furretuwu, really cool would a simple sample what only use the simplest options to send some string and tracing out the incomming result from openAI-service
ahh.. thats for the POST data ?
<@456226577798135808> what is the typedefs for at here: <https://github.com/FurretDev/hxopenai/blob/main/hxopenai/Typedefs.hx> ?
and of all the blender-ui-features you can only use the ones what is relevant for your game-asset-creation-pipeline!
\o/
so you can e.g. create own editor-app and export from there into haxe-data or castle-db or whatever
<https://code.blender.org/2022/11/blender-apps/>
this year they plan also to make a new feature called "create your own blender-app"
i always get really jealous when i see how easy everything is nowadays in blenders python console and the scripting there (and everything can be used and integrated directly into the ui)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/shaders/distancefield>
e.g. we can all make into blender-addon for that MSDF-old-samplething!
hey... will really do more into blender again this year
😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opZy2OJp8co&list=PLa1F2ddGya_8acrgoQr1fTeIuQtkSd6BW&index=1
(really _relaxing_ ...BobRoss-LIKE 😍 )
apropo ... coding-learning videos ... i found some cool lessons yesterday ...
the `TileMap` there is also fast ! ... not sure how is it into "zooming" ...
for a "strategy map"-gamefeature i would try to use separate lowres-textureatlas there!
🤐
Oh ..really? 😅
maybe there is a better one inside of Flixel-Samplespace for!
(or how to enable mipmap-levels inside of OpenFL/Flixel)
not sure how you also can set the min/magnitude filters there.
so into Flixel there is the "smooth" for (same as into openfl ?)
here its also good to see: <https://jamesobfisher.gitlab.io/peote-samples/TextureMipmapFilter/>
if you using OpenGL based renderer than sometimes you have: Mipmapping (what can be also filled by pre-scaled texture-data!)
also into 2d-animationtweening into general
(to avoid jittering)
into zooming-anim its sometimes need to use fully pixel sized scale-states
i am created the assets into blender ... then imagemagic - pipeline to create the tilemaps from the single rendered parts of frames ....
the "compositing" is done at _runtime_ for!
sure ;)
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-view-remaster-demos/>
we have to write first sample for it seems 😆
(runs smooth here at fullscreen also -> 1920x1280)
look at old demo here: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-view-remaster-demos/bin/>
best is if it is -> scalable ... so if window resizing!
hey Half ..old friend ... we should write little ui sample tonight whats using Furrets: <https://github.com/FurretDev/hxopenai>
🙈 -> chatgpt ... what is haxe ?
chatgpt: "Isn't that the language where you can write rythm-games into?" 😂
32x32 ?
not so many people have set foot on the moon yet either (^_^)
*lol
(in peote-ui it very _diffs_ if you using monospace/tiled font or distancefield/packed + kerning also!)
have here some what integrates a very long text + sliders to scroll: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/LargeText.hx#L107>
we only will know after comparing ;)
(with really long text to scroll inside .. have still some sample for what text we can use!)
egui versus haxeui vs peote-ui \o/
if your haxelib works we can compare text-edit-widget performance 😅 !
mhm.. i need to see a simple haxe-sample first ;:)
ah, so you write the extern wrappers for both? (c and wasm) to use by haxe 🙂 ?
(me never tryed by haxe yet)
ah... wasm ... yep..much using nowa to transpile c to web
oh.... so it using the web-port then from the rust-one? (<https://github.com/emilk/egui> ?)
also html5-target?
can you make it also crossplatform ..you know ...
"dear" sounds good !!!
(and most comlicate was going there into text-rendering and make text "editable"!)
no no ... wanna have my own haxelime-peote ui ... important is that it looks and behaves the same on all haxelime-openGL targets!
my peote-ui also gets little progress ... i am near to have "textselection" now also for the "UITextPage"-widget there ( then only undobuffer and most complicate shit is done there! )
cool ... what is they saying inside rust-community about ?
ah ... is that rust ?
jo ... (best experiences into past i did into curses and tk)
gui coding is allways horrible ~~
😂
oh... they was steal the name ?
(was much better than `mailx` ;)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(E-Mail-Programm)
"elm" .. i am only remember to that old email-client i am was using long ago
use TK ;:)

(and i need to `edit` the logo a little bit for at first!)
<@694560611601743893> best i am think would be simple and really slow -> `rotation`

Best <@694560611601743893> <@371312079526952960> would be to build your own or what is into your mind about that ?
_try _ try _ try _try _Try _tr y- -> 😢
or -> try out the `next`
try out -> use it
use <@371312079526952960> s lib-tools also (if it works for you!)
yeah, nanji using good math (even if it not good to see into code there!)
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/turbostone/haxeBysemmi/>
we do good `democode` tonight!

or do you have better idea ?
x0 y0 + x1 y1
and `0` and `1` for points/lineInbetweeN
let us keep `Start` and `End` only for -> anim
~_~
out of the box there i mean
<@694560611601743893> sorry that not all is `vector`
thAnk you
x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 --- > x`n`

i will do all into nanji-style at now:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/b9fe698b10fdd07d5ebe152abee560e9d86feb65>
<@694560611601743893> -> <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/turbostone/>
(hashlink also fast now!)
now!
`new Buffer<TurboLine>(16384, 4096, true)` -> more SPEED
ahhhh
(moment.. will upload my last changes [sry])
html5 - js needs also its time to render

half, or cos of `slow` -> `var buffer = new Buffer<TurboLine>(32, 16, true);` maybe?
(100x100 needs to long on neko .. lemme test on js-engine)
10x10

anyway .. lemme draw 100x100
(old one only for compatibility ;:)
to not have to type any bracket!
getter+setter
color.rnd
(have to make more `alias` !!! )
Color.random()
sure

or fully grid at first ?
so now -> coloring ?

finally:
same (perfect proved;:)

if only changing ending-points
how it will look
now lets see
if only changing the start points
this it is looking
for ( i in 0...10 )
var x0 = Std.int(start.x+i*64);
(^_^)
first try

and now -> 10 x 10
```
var size = 64;
var x = -32 ;
var y = -32;
```
half:

`class SemmisFirstIdea extends Application`
(10 min!)
lemme try
(and every line-point gets -> random<- by `instantiating` ;:)
mhm... at now i am only have idea to make 23 x 17 haxe-logos into a `grid`
i am will make a little `sample` code for!
Half (or others;) -> what ever you need ...
into sample -> 🌌
not have to be only "SVG" or "XML" for me _personally_ i mean ,)~
much more can be done later if we have UITextPage and little "editor" inside!
jo .. i am hope it helps <@371312079526952960> more to test out the code (like a math-double-literat-prooving;)
)
(need to make some easy sample sometimes to "inject" also custom `OpenGLideCode`
(only into "triangle-gl-pure-drawing .. uk .. have some problems there!!!)
hey.. if some glitch int o -> will fix it -> just in time !!!
(the haxe tools also!)
ever
<:blobninja:964199767607476275>
_to let the code_ -> `run` '^
it *feels for me more and more!
<@694560611601743893> we are -> `team`
*hugs
~~
(really was thought at some point you let me alone)
-> haxe flow was really good for me tonight!

you can`t believing into what is `POSSIBLE` at now
i am not sure you know, but peote-view is also a `particle` and `procedural texture generation` engine (from ground of!)
<@371312079526952960> into peote-ENV ?
<@371312079526952960> whats you idea how to animate the cool self created haxe logo by half now ?
... whatever;:)
(only for "multipaint"-sample ...
(still "uptime" im mean)
for new -> `requests` 😂
peote-server also still waiting

no
where is code ?

sorry ,,, was playing with halfwheats new editor




wait whats going on if i am will run my `milkpiss`-engine (rewritten!) there!!!! ;:)

upload by scp to maitag please!
(you asked me about!)
only my IDEAS at night ;:)
(directly after prev-next frame navigation)
a `red` colored -> `PLAY`button
What your UI is really need is ->
Lets doing that now (or into next _session_ :)
your "animation"-way is much cooler that what i am thought into simple particle-animation
<@694560611601743893> (^^)?
and bring you back to the last `frame` numer (of 255) you was editing before!
and while its _playing_ the button-text have to switch to "Stop"
(inside of editor!)
also!
button
`PLAY`
a
and you need
(to not make "copy" to much -> redundant!)
but need -> `delay` value after each `frame`
(THAT\o/)
(we should -> animate!)
eh.. how is that into -> JSON ?
did seen this first time at now
\o/
-> -> FRAME BY FRAME ?
-> W T H
buttons
prev next
but at now i am first time tryed out
woah
(mhm .. pressing the "save" button not works here)
ok .. lemme try (hope not needs to long at now [really late and after beer i am not sure to gettit ;:])
of the `default` turbo-asset we have `IN` at now :) [halfhandcreated]
<@694560611601743893> or do you think i am should `ANIMATE` that `TURBO` lines at now ?

(wanna have -> `exactly the same VERSION` of turbostone EDITOR at now ;:)*hugs
i mean .. how do you created the haxe-logo ?
<@694560611601743893> where is the latest version hosted ?
into en de en de en de encoding
but not -> writing <-
why i am have -> reading <- now
<http://maitag.de/~half/2023/turbo-stone/alpha-0000/>
not works
i am try to press the "save" button
but look at me
into graphic-asset-pipeline
(thouthandTimesBetter than svg-[parsing]shittyness!)
i mean ... easy to use format (+superfasteditor)
manifested into json or haxe notation ?
at now
its -> turbo-FORMAT
IMPORT
eh.. why do you think i am need
(to test out the new workflow)
and load it in again
no no .. my only idea was at now to change the haxe-logo
to improive the editor ?
(_intoTime_)
(get much if night goes long)
what exactly into conversation?
(roblem)
(L->P)
(NI)
lets better talk some shit
dont hurry
wanna -> "SHARE" 😂 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
i am using not latest version =?=

(anyway.. we have the "haxe" logo inside at now ~~)
<http://maitag.de/~half/2023/turbo-stone/alpha-0000/> SAVE button not works
<@694560611601743893> what would be best into -> animate <- (by the way--- > need to test more assetcreationflow [m o m e n t ;])
<@151104106973495296> what was problem into haxebotcode ? (new api-changes was break it?)
(nanj.strokeWidth = 5)

works!
-> just paths
(pixelimage also can be easy testing later ... need to finish my integrated text-editor [sandbox!])
or do a bountybranch ... its up to you
(-> can understand)
(so others who ever wanna use it [or we some years later!])
(only keep it -> simple!)
feel free at all the time to create also folders there
hey.. wish many dreams (of "cats" ;:)4SURE!
(before animating)

do you also wanna invite Nanji ?
any what Lycy in the Sky was opened ... lets look at our samplecode
no balance ... to small maybe
do you have "salamander" inside ?
ah
😢
and he loves eating _apples_
is have to much of bad sugar-molecule maybe (all is -> the SAME there!)
fuckingsupermarket
my father have diabetis at now .. and all apple-kind-of you can buy into >
( e.g. -> no genetic variation anymore <- )

apple is best fruit into the northern lands
framebuffer is no need! (peote-view have -> "render into texture" ;:)

-> more OUT then IN or IN - OUT ?
apropos Nanji... old FRIEND ....
\o/
woahow
How the same would look like into <:flixel:230369617774641152> ?
(only 3 hx files -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src> )
<@151104106973495296> what do you say ? (about our haxe codingstyle into ?)
(if forget how to use -> simple sample code is there at now! )
that now everyone can using the editor to draw assets for peote-view!
but the best is into
and how to encode into peote-view line element coordinates back
all is better separated also ... into what is format into
looks good
(center of gravity;:)
you maybe have to make a "pivot" point also into JSON later
cool
ah... the zero-point is also into middle allways ? (into turbostone format i mean ?)
(also for others out of us easy to understand!)
really good now to build up on!
`TurboTranslate` ... -> _interesting_ also
Half, Du bist ein Schatz 😘

PERFECT

is new
```haxe
@:structInit
class DataFile {
    public var lines:Array<Line>;
}
```
*LOL
;:)
KNOW
need to

moment (will diff MOREbefore i am press the run button)
(into TurboLine)
ah.. new color default ....
(lemme _Checkout_ 🍻 !!!=)
IN
so not wanna have that there anymore =?
and -> `m o d u l a r`
Nanji... you have to think -> `constructive`
lets see what will be at the end!
to extend the samplecode
everyone have at max 1 or 1/2 hour
(do you also wanna _invite_ 🙂 ?)
half and me playing ping pong coding game tonight
where ?
(at same `point`)
(to avoid `parallel` coding)
(but not wanna continue into code until halfs commits not changes in)
(wanna also "animate" it tonight!!!)
moment ... lets wait for halfs-final-encoding
😭 but WHY ?
(have also old "leo"-perlscript on term)
np
what is that numbers for ?
e.g. .. i am start typing into here "tra..." and it gimme "translate" and not "trace" ( shitty autocomplete here sometimes into my end-client)
<@151104106973495296> whats wrong into haxebot ? ( no trace no translate [sometimes also autocomplete gimme the wrong 🕳️  )
<@694560611601743893> you really safed me the day (or better the night!!!) -> it is `R U N` \o/
-> `turbo`-`stone`-> Format
moment (half will show -> final `en`-code now .)
🍻 🍾 🥂 \o/ *hugs Half superdeeeep
YEAH
or `Algebra`-View ?=
do you mean into `Analysis` ?
oh ... your math killing haxebot * * * 🙈
if RAM is _neverEnough_ and CPU/GPU have to get -> ❤️‍🔥
🩳 -Int *lol ;:)
i have -> little big int .)
27698 ^ 5.78
to make it `run`
<@694560611601743893> you not have to make a git-pr also if to much overhead...
simple paste me the TurboData.hx back ( json2object lib already added to project.xml )
loader here works at all targets

(neko)
loading json text correctly here

what .. here it was working
(wanna -> ANIMATE *LOOOL :;)\o/
any ... half, do you still try to make that json2obj ?
ah ok
13 ?
oooh.. so MANY ?
<@215582414544699393> <@371312079526952960> -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/TurboData.hx#L27>
<@694560611601743893> how is into `json2object` ?
yep .. exactly this is cos half and me make it only into -> outer-straight-lines <- format at now!
<@371312079526952960> and to use without need to think about!
(to easy extend also later!)
turbostone-editor need good haxe-format for i mean!
-> for me was to long ago
do you good into `json2object` =?
(\sAmplEs/)
(_really kisslike_!)
(i am really like halfs stuff!)
sure ... but at first sample for halfs cool new asset-creator-editor tool please <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108>
wanna help us into new sample Nanjizal ?
for the line ?
(but tonight -> every line of haxelogo will be -> animate also ^^)
(every pixel is peote-element)
(later wanna make simmiliar animation like into the Pixel-fun last time you remember=?)
TONIGHT 🌌 !
-> i am WANNA RENDER ;:)
it is! (handmade by half into turbo-stooone;|)
Half, shit.. i am forgot the scaling.. but that better also have to be inside of Main.hx (to keep simplest) .. i mean the `offset` to add and `size` to multiplicate per TurboData line
`TurboLine` and `TurboData` ... ? .. is that okey into namespace ;)?= for you to?
<@371312079526952960> ... how do you think it is looking at now ? (need to be super-simple and best into namespace to let us easy dive into later to build up on!)
```haxe
var turboLines = TurboData.decode(json);
for ( line in turboLines )
   buffer.addElement( new TurboLine(line.??? , line.??? , line.??? , line.??? ) );
```
into main only now:
`TurboData` encoding is _your_ part at now 😅 (needAsmOke;:)
\o/
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src>
Half,  💓  ....one more step further at now
(1/2h;:)
can not simple copy ("Turbo" need -> FORMAT ;:)
(^_^)
moment... i will try now!
ok ... that will need some minutes
into try.haxe now is to much for me 😂
mhm... do you not using somewhere (and send me link to that point where it already working into ?)
thx.. lemme try out
(how to "fill" the _closed surfaces_ also can be done later!)
<@694560611601743893> at now its time to _render_ the haxe-logo (created by hand inside of turbo-stone;)
will be -> polishing all later!
at best (but will do later!) if there also is all only x0/y0 and x1/y1-getter/setter
(needs "color" later into constructor.. any ;)
"TurboLine" looks better now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src/TurboLine.hx>
k
(not used json2obj since some months)
json2obj code
mhm, thats to complicate ... i am need the
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineTurbostone/src>
`TurboLine`
oh ... sorry... was still renaming into
oh.. we have "name"-conflict at now
np
to use the created artwork into only 1 line of code ? (and import)
or do you think that "Turbostone" can be make easy as little lib
<@694560611601743893> was still using the "CPU"-version of the "line" from previous samples (that ones i am will clean up also later to make it into one folder for both-versions!)
( 3-> animating \o/)
next 2 steps:
1) input2action .hx to map the format
2) loop to create the lines
( was need to make some cleanup stuff at first to easy let replace the line-element later by GPU or Animated types ;)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines>
anyway ... to late .. i am still started now 😂  ->
moment.. (still creating the prototype)
<@371312079526952960> wanna try to read halfs turbostone-edit-data now into new sample !
🪗
its like _music_ 🎶 quintett
quintessence :)
( the vanishing-point need to be "vanishable" *lol ... e.g. it needs an "infinite" position at some special case .. .and best would be a smooth transition from there into "finite"-space then! )
not sure at now how to implement that transformation by vertex-shader

<@371312079526952960> what really _good to have_ for peote-quad-transform into future would be "vanishing points" :
on old win7 you not have that "update" anymore (it only updates the spyware-stuff from time to time)
also it would be good to have an `update`-method to store the gl-texture data back into TextureData (where at now only `texture.readPixelsUInt8()` is used for)...
e.g. to cast also easy back to lime-Image after render2texture.
ah ... yeah, by `TextureData` all will be more easy (i need to make more @from/@to there and also better `Texture`-Integration with the "slots")
yeah, was working \o/ (no more Moiré also into surfaces)
<@371312079526952960> out of _myself_ ?
and no one can using my haxe-gl tools sometimes ?
<@215582414544699393> do you also _thinking_ that i am `producing` to much ?
<@694560611601743893> <@371312079526952960> my sample-demos also will be sometimes -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware

<@371312079526952960> how is `definition` to let draw a simple point (out of `resolution`) into?
(long ago ..any .. what <@486327776077676565> is your "graphically" into haxe?)
(last time i am looked into)

(haxe is really _vanispointed_ out there into "game-bge-logic" of default tmpl)

wow.. that really lookingNeedleNow\o/
into `exploring` haxe and all there ;)
Wanna work not `alone`
Nanji .. what builds on top of eachother into your holy libstack here (where is old "triliteral" .. i am more and more getting lost of _overview_)=~
for what do you are use or will use just path for your own ?
it the math behind of "interpolation"
no
not only
<@371312079526952960> there is definitively `fractalstructure` by _deeper zooming in_!
wanna -> `ZOOM` in|out
do you also have your own multi-tools for now ? (or more html-ui-focus?)
how do you `render` this for all the haxe-gl/pureBitData-targets ?
mhm... not really -> `random` into _fuzzynes_ and blur-fill
(both into same part of "codemodule" can be strange sometimes)
or runtimeoptimized?
Nanji, what is your goal ... mathematically correct
-> `interpolation` _glitches_ still into!
yEAH?
plsNotLemmeAlone
(hereIntoChatLog😂)
hey half ... where do you was 🤿 - 🌊 o d e `?
into your tools
-> just path was best for me at now (to try out)
(never get it easy running)
`justPath` folder please
hey ... but better a new
for "gradients" there is also -> folder
~s/commits/comments
i am will put into code "some commits" -> only after i am was understanding myself for sure into -> how to use!

(with my old shitty ui-unfinished)
any .. i am happy to get the magicOdingFloWback ;:)
i am not understanding so good engl- anymore (writing is more easy!)
<@371312079526952960> so late at night (and get not much sleep the last one and day ...)
( its supercool i mean .... where is all that using into OpenFL .. or Flixel ? )
the old-flashplayer-"graphics-API" ... why you are still using nowadays ?
😂 ... nanji ... you have to post -> screenshots ... to what it is -> _project into 2D_
<@456226577798135808> and what would be better than the _newest fun ever into_ ;:)?
<@456226577798135808> need some `modern tools` to make litte demos/samples for my `peote-ui` lib (have own superfast text-rendering there and wanna test out-into-lib-combinations!)
(half and me .... w ... a.... i ....t ....i.....g <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> )
re-arrange how you like and then only pull back (pingpong;)
so not writing new sample tonight -_-?=
you need -> haxe ui `sliders` for ~^
(that will be our 🪡 🌉  for testing .. before i am have time to implement a more optimized way for triangle-drawing directly inside of my _renderengine_)
ah ... pixelimage
where ? ... into your renderer ?
haxe need -> `algebraic` !
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09445>
(with non-enDless numberspace ;:)
on computer
what we doing is -> let it run in time
curve-interpolation throught points is since hundret of yeart a complex unsolved math problem you know ?
me like to use only `fragment` shader and into complexnumber-2d-coords like
`soft-shapes` allways then ?
( i am hope i get the "selection" ready also into next days for -> little text-edit-widget ... only refactoring here at now )
<@694560611601743893> and me need to p r e p a r e   our -> tools
i mean -> next gamejam is near
( into my mind allways is -> asset-generation at runtime ... only ~_~)
for what do you have use-case for at now ?
yep ... -> thats the `crew` here for sure (^_^) *lol
into `curve` - and `interpolation`
yeah.. sometimes you have to _hover_ some _dimensions_ up or down
\o/ ... woah

cool ... looks like a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf>
(and later ... if some silent moment to write some words there into Readme.whatever then i am can easy link to each of them -> how to do into haxelimepeotejustpath <- WAY)
(i am one who more like to create 10 little samplecodes .. instead of writing 1 line of documentation into readme you know)
and how to let use it inside of my little _renderer_
nanji .. i am also test from time to time other haxelibs
(what is that 🙂 =)=)==?
there is only "uk" *LOL
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/Main.hx#L86>
where some one was changing something into code .... or cos of here:
my goal is to -> `TEST` that (and how we can use it inside of peote-view renderer)
who .. me ? (i am not touching anything onto your repos!)
should i make new folder into root "nanji" ? .. (or "justPath" ?)
(nanji, you are intived you know to also _commit_ into!)
pls friends, lets collect all into -> new folder for samples!
mhm.. is kiwi also svg-data-src?
😂
(based on the other samplecodes there)
without simple samples i am have no plan tonight where to start
mhm.. i am thought you already have svg-parser working there
like into `graphics` of old as3
(but later .. at now we have 2 test-SVG ... it should be work out of the box!)
(and from there it can be converted into -> any)
(the pure haxe-curve-data i mean into all of _representation_ there)
-> we need it into `Blender`!
(triangle-drawing-optimization i am can implement sometimes later ... also will be very good tool without optimized drawing )
how should i name that ... a sample to see how to generate SVG there would be really cool!
<@371312079526952960> also i am think it needs new folder for all what is using `justPath`-lib ....
<@694560611601743893> wanna really try also to let the pixels flow for some of the new assets we have now into folder: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/assets>
this was the last `state` here into my mind of:
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/MainPixelAnim.hx#L50>
<@371312079526952960> by the way, is svg-parsing still working also without triangle-peote-wrapper function there into last samples? (wanna really try with the haxe-logo.svg 🙂 !)=

-> lets animate the haxe-SVG-drawing (still have all open here into code-editor!!!! )
<@371312079526952960> anyway ... better lets -> `combine` what we was written into haxelibs .... now i am really happy into ...
(thats also why it would be so hard to change peote-view renderer by design at now ... really i am _tryed_ to support triangles to let better use your tools!!! 🥹 !!!!)
for only `3` -> can draw one `triangle`
If i am have `2 points` -> enought to define a circle or a square
to let each of them `cross` one of the `points`!
How many circular `curve` of _circle_, _quad_, _tri_ and such i am can draw...
Nanji, i am like to ask me: if i am have 2 or 3 points on a plane ,,,... ...
(-> `point-interpolation` )
i am wanna edit (or to build up from `polygon` for more of!)
anyway ... into blender i am can choose what `type` of curve/shape
oh.. it really have that also now ...
they wanna have them ALL it seems ;:)
(krita more like photoshop)
on need ... i am only would use inkscape (krita is no vector-graphics)
inkscape is best
really liked also into flash8 the line-drawing/editing (later into "CS" [adobeshit!!!]-> only bugs and glitches)
(any tool [2d] was different into the past ... best of all was also by OLD macromedia Illustrator or before into `quarks` .. all later -> buggy/incompatible...)
i am only use nowadays blender for any 2d or 3d (or Nday) 
`curve`-editcreationings
(then better not let us using into haxe/lime/justpath/peote/tracker -> samplespace for _starters)
:(
<:haxegoop:849827723676221480>
own `creation` i mean
oooch.. thouhght it was same as your pixel-avatar-paintings
-_-
do you created that iconographic from your mind Bulby or had some template for ?
🙈
(but look at what is into old AS3 code for Flashplayer!)
anyway .. maybe they also have something like `hxcompat` or simmiliar
<@371312079526952960> if my personal `older` code not `run` anymore -> makes me angry
(that _matters only_ if someone destroying my "stable"-coding-"environment" ;)
and Oracle makes it so hard now to use some older java-versions
e.g. Adobe was destorying flashplayer ... wtf
(its only my personal think .. between me and Oracle, Microsoft and Adobe and some others to ;:)
no, why do you think ?
(but there is maria now ... also libre-office and better tools!)
(same who was stolen MySQL)
it stealing it from SUN ;)
💯
openjdk is much more accessible
woah... oracle (*hides)
mhm... what means `sbt` ?
(now we know why 😆 )
*LOL
is this by you?
ahh.. very good stilisation
what is that svg ;:) ? [pls send a screenshot to see!]
mhm (maybe first converting into postscript and then back ?)
(or new bulby-art ^^?)
(another haxelogo version ?)
try to use your head (half or me can write the Loader.text() stuff !)

hi NotBilly ... by the way ... do you have good haxe.svg for us ?
`a` and `b` sometimes really good for parameter-wrapping (e.g. into haxe-abstracts @from/@to)
but not "a" "e" "v" "q" or something together (only for some pure math-shit it will be ok ... e.g. is "e" is allways for "energy" and "m" for Mass or something
sometimes is OK
only "a" , "n" or something ....
the Thing IS ... if you have "more" of them ... it will be complicate
ah, i thought cos of `^`
XOR is COOL
finally: `for(i=> item in items)`
no no .. better there: `for (item in items)`
len, size ... there are better ways
"l" is hard to read (cos of "I")
jo
`l`?
also never used ... (since haxe 4?)
anyway -> OUR haxe-justpath-peoteView samples is -> TASTY and Fresh *LOL
it depends ... if you need an index the second approach not helps
spaghetticode (last time i am was looking into 😂 )
jo.. fnf-code is -> fast prototyped
*joking
( some bugs still since 8.0 inside of lime on neko and hashlink! )
so -> absolute fast at !
lime is optimizing for native
so i am can load all into same manner
no no ... into lime that helper is more easy
that one can load `async` and crosstarget lime-images, pure text or also binary (all also sequentially many at ones)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/tree/master/src/utils>
jupp ... cos can be also used with pure Lime (without of peote-view)
y e a h
\o/
<@371312079526952960> ```haxe
utils.Loader.text( assetPath,
  function(loaded:Int, size:Int) trace('loading progress ' + Std.int(loaded / size * 100) + "%" , ' ($loaded / $size)'),
  function(errorMsg:String) trace('error $errorMsg'),
  function(text:String) // on load
  { ...
  }
);```
(can easy read into by `Loader`-tool of peote!)
lets try the lime.svg
thats no problem
or the lime ones (that one is still inside of asset-folder: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/assets>)
\o/ .. come on .. lets draw the haxe.svg (wanna let is also _explode_ 😂)
can really _feel_ it ... how much is there behind 🙂 ?
the build-time has been extended somewhat by using `justPath`
(and animPosition not need to set position out of screen also anymore, quite more simple by "constant" interpolation!)
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commit/adf088838a3f5ee465f0fe6d811f906f4aef01f6>
<@371312079526952960> <@694560611601743893> http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/nanjiDraw/drawPixelAnim_01/
(oh, not so easy to use my old code for because it also needs `getPixel()` for!)
ok.. single pixel is animated .... will try to draw a simple `maze` for testing ;)
<@371312079526952960> how would samplecode there look to draw the haxe-logo 😅 ?
```haxe
@posX @anim("Position") public var x:Int;
@posY @anim("Position") public var y:Int;
//...
public function new(x:Int, y:Int, color:Color) {
  var xOutOfScreen = x + 800 + Std.random(128);
  var yOutOfScreen = y + 600 + Std.random(128);
  if ( Std.random(2)==0 ) xOutOfScreen *= -1;
  if ( Std.random(2)==0 ) yOutOfScreen *= -1;
  animPosition(x, y, xOutOfScreen, yOutOfScreen);
  timePosition(0.0, 3.0); // from start-time (0.0) and during 3 seconds 
}
```
there can be also simple PixelAnim.hx like:
so starting by this: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/Pixel.hx>
now also each Pixel can be animated .. e.g. to a random position at peoteView.start()
yeah 🙂
Wonder how much faster it is into using peote-view now for "drawPixel" (and then maybe render2texture)
-> versus normal html-canvas pixelsetting
internally its handle as a space-glyphe + special-size ... so can be set to e.g. 2 or 3 spaces
<@694560611601743893> found a way now also how to best integrate `TAB`s inside of peote-text (thats really need for little glsl-codeeditor inside of ;)
ok, its merged ... much faster now to draw simple pixel
internally rgba .. but you can choose also rgb or argb: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/Color.hx#L12>
(will look after lunch \o/)!!!!! 💓 !!!!!!!!\o/
only heared about but not watched yet (thx for the tip ^^)
(also long ago i am was wrote a _demo_ ... but pls understand me -> peote-text have to run `stable` sometimes!

maybe only YOU not need good UI at now (and Nanji you maybe only use HTML for)
(no "little ui" -> no Fun "for me" :,)
sure -> but NEED!
at best!
thats the -> testcase
no no no -> i am render -> 100 000 little "glyphes"-elements all the time inside of peote-ui every day while _testing_
and all i am need is there!
i am already using it for peote-ui
really ? (can use them all together 😍 ? .. didn't knowed that .. thats gimme really hope now to put my stuff sometimes also inside of!)
.. so therefore all is build up and designed for -> x/y + w/h  only (to make easy map to texture into any way and customized by glsl-fragmentshaderFOCUS also!)
I am really try to keep my "peote"-stuff as simple as possible into 2d-Land...
how to -> split the room <- into tiles ?
do you know do-decaeder and suchs
no no .. i mean into kind of "platonic" - body -> ELEMENTS?
throught the -> 🌌
to make a -> pattern
you know how complicate that is Nanji?
but to "sort" little "spheres" into 3D Space
🐉
s
😂
-> : STRING :
or little circle/ellipses
3d needs triangles really i am think1
( wanna USE my ui there also sometimes into 3d-space! )
( armory is better than old BGE and have much more potential for me! [old BGA also was perfect!!!])
( i am LOVE it !!!! ♥️  ... hey Nanji .. i am using Blender and also as developer since 20 years and more)
(wanna make peote-view sometimes "compatible" also!)
or g4?
g5 ?
what is using armory-LTS ?=
(where we 🪝 -> 🪢 <- ⚓  themTogether!)
(that only WILL BE POSSIBLE -> into SMALLEST _little_ samples!)
(no one can understand ALL anymore of COMPLEXITY into Code of the otherone i mean!)
i am only mean ->
or "justPath"
🌉
we should better try :  `triliteral^peote` and `peote^triliteral`
if i am would try to understand your code together with math behind .. it would need years for me at now!
you can do whatever you wanna (you are the profi into your drawing-engine!)
Best at first for sure -> only ONE line-animation-TEXT
but the "-end" values have to be set -> out of screen -> randomly!
so "xstart/ystart" is like at now
i would -> animate <- all lines out of screen (for "explosion"-particle-anim)
wow.. that is a good start
( bulby have this here into -> y <- Direction: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/bulby/src/Main.hx#L24> -> `time1*time1` .. its like y = x^2 formula! )
(like for <@215582414544699393> s anim .. it only makes "linear" animation into horizontally ... and "exponential"-jumping into "vertically")
@const is only -> optimization-thing
and you can _change_  element-instances property by haxe at runtime
remove the `@const`
( @constStart() and @constEnd() is more like -> only HELPERS for @ANIM ther into)
`@const` means its is `statically replace` that "VALUE" inside GLSL at the end (no more acces throught haxe then at runtime!)
only!
all -> TEMPLATES
`peote-view` also have some (older) Element-Samples here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/tree/master/src/elements>
--- > needa Text-Input-UI there -> `testing` - SANDBOX makes all more easy to `explain`!)
(my brain still `STICK` into -> funkyTEXT-rendering .. but not long i brain-is-clear here and more open for...
only one i am know who know how to use is my friend <@694560611601743893>
my shit also is much undocumented -_-
-> HEY -> that have the "GAME-TITLE" for next JAM \o/ .. hurray
WOAHHHAHA
🤣
anusRectusNormalus
*LOL
rectal
Nanji, did you ever tryed OpenFL->Tilesheet or newer TileMAp ?
(and most -> flexible!)
yep
rotatable rectangles ;)
(all is superoptimized for 2D into peote-view!)
not like standard-opengl
Nanji: not 4 times x/y
a Quadratic -> only x/y and SIZE
no no -> a CIRCLE e.g. only need x/y middle-point and RADIUS
(half, can it be that we "think" all the time the SAME here while CHATTING 🌅 ;:)
\o/ yeah
`var setPixel ()->`
yeah.. better also would be a
```haxe
@sizeX @const public var w:Int = 1;
@sizeY @const public var h:Int = 1;
``` (for 1x1 pixel)
into that case all is only directly compiled into GLSL-Code at the end (all elements have same size and can not be changed later -> faster into rendering then!)
you can make them also -> `@const`
into glsl-code it will be all reduced (also vertex-buffer not need `h` anymore!)
than make only
```haxe
@sizeX public var w:Int=100;
@sizeY @formula("w") public var h:Int;
```
call it `Pixel` instead of "Sprite" here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/_starter/src/Sprite.hx#L6>
@posX, @posY, @sizeX, @sizeY is the only need for you Nanji!
make a "quad" not a line!
(its real power is into -> simple animation of ALL of Elements ... and into shaderspice to combine "pixels" intO any way later!)
(peote-engine can not do spice like that!)
your engine have totally different approach into drawing
can not be "mixed" really into how Bulbys-Pixeltilesheed is "bumped"
to keep simple
make it -> 1 pixel sized all the time
i would start into "static" -> `w`-width
x... depends (by @formula) on `w` ... and also `w` on x... (not possible to solve!)
yeah, thats -> cyclic <- <@694560611601743893>
`@sizeX @const @formula("sqrt( (xStart-xEnd)*(xStart-xEnd) + (yStart-yEnd)*(yStart-yEnd) )") public var w:Int;`
aahh.. see it now
oh, where is `w` ?
(by the builded "animation-formula" inside of glsl at the end)
so if "with" is depend on "xstart" .. and "xstart" on "width" ... it can not be resolved
ah, that error is if you try to make some element-property depend of some other .. and that depend back into (so no way to "solve"!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/anim/rain/src/Rain.hx#L25>
at once!
to move all Elements (the raindrops into that case)
-> only `peoteView.start()` at the end of into haxecode
there is no updating like _"normal"_ need!
-> <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/>
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/anim-simple/>
look at this: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim>
*lol
but not the REAL "peote"-WAY :;)
thats also possible into peote
smoothly into something other (have to be same amount of lines than!)
every line can have "start" and "end" ... e.g. to "morph" the KIWI
<@371312079526952960> look how <@215582414544699393> s pixelart is animated (without any line of haxe-code later 😂 ) -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/bulby/src/Main.hx#L23>
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/LineSegment.hx#L6>
xStart/end and so on need -> @animation spice
Kiwis LINES could also -> animate
to make -> particle-effect of Kiwi
All together i mean
interesting would be to let the "line-element" -> moving by GPU at
`peoteView.start()` .) [like into Bulby animation]
sorry.. have no "ci" yet (only half have that into his own repo!)
rendering is ok, but -> buffer.addElement() will be much faster then ( if you need lots of)
everywhere
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/Main.hx#L40>)
is need!
`Buffer<LineSegment>(65535, 4096, true);`
that means ... after adding every 4. line .. it will increasing the vertex-buffer
at now there is: `buffer = new Buffer<LineSegment>(4, 4, true);`
buffersize -> 0xFFFF
it `IS` the "canvas"
peote-view have no "canvas" ...
half is much younger (i am only would -> copy/paste :;)
😂
*WOAH
(e.g. 100 little _arrows_ moving on screen)
(-> before -> _animationfun_)
(-> will try out this sometimes to draw into peote-`TextureData`)
i am prefare the _simple arrow-xml_ at now
*hugs <@371312079526952960>
at now i am really like the way how it is `bind`
yeah ... -> simple samples <- also have to be not code-overbloated
anyway... i am like your `tools` (wanna also use my peote-ui text-edit sometimes to make the "definition" for arrows or something to "paint" into -> texture ... and using that texture then inside of peote-view-optimizations
what is not working 🥲 ?
then .. e.g. ... you can make cool effects where all the painted graphics later will "explode" into _thousands_ of pixels or something
(instead of "canvas" i mean)
i am like the idea also: aproximating the Triangles by Pixelquads 🙂
(was wonder where the "Element" was ~_~)
aahh... understanding now: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/lines/lineNanjizalDraw/src/Main.hx#L47> ... it only give the function-pointer to NanjizalDraw there
jo, matrix is much better and modern (also most important: decentral)
😂
-> had
(was sometimes into FNF -> there was totally waterfall of meme-raining-down-on-me *LOL ;:)
oh, is there a haxe-discord where are more I/O ?
<@371312079526952960> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines>
(oh ... totally forget .. there is also new Sample for Nanji into peote-samples repo again \o/ .. YEAH)
(i am like that into _Chatting_ ;:)
❤️‍🔥
-> ♥️ - ATTACK
*LOL
<@215582414544699393> your pixel-art-style  is also interesting
on computer i am really like to use "mypaint" for
(pen have not to hard and not to soft!)
you have to find your `own` scribblestyle
all good things to do or to learn needs -> `time`
only problem is -> have no "tabulator"s yet inside of peote-text rendering *lol (that will need some silent moment to hack that into the huge code there sometimes) ... really need for little "code-editor"
also to "overwrite" only some of the "default"-keyboard/controler-bindings there
(did only prototyped it here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/SimpleText.hx#L197> still now)
we can all have that super-customizable (will make into a new sample later!)
and move that up/down by ctrl-alt-up/down
or `ctrl d` to duplicate a line
wanna also have ctrl-cursorkey (to jump fast between the words)
its all only -> like lego <- at now
forgot to delete the comments there
jo
the "clothes" also needs more "control-strikes" (like for the face)
Half, and here is cool "input2action-lib"-bindings: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/src/peote/ui/interactive/input2action/InputTextPage.hx#L15>
the more you paint, the better you go
its only -> training
(no more `lag` while `editing text` 🙂 inside of an haxe-program)
all really rude code there .. but any -> fastest text-edit-widget ever
( "paste" also works ... but for "copy" i am still need to implement the "multilineselection" inside the UITextPage )
hey, my "text-page"-rendering also is _refactored_ at now .. so better to maintain and no more bugs into UITestPage-widget: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/SimpleText/>
exactly ... better starting simple and then more and more "versions" of what goes more into details
sample is also minimal ... but sometimes i will do another file there what makes tha "secondsRemaining" and "secondsDuration" also little bit -> _random_
yeah .. thanks to Half <:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
(oh, and for sure -> input2action ... thats so cool now to make all simple assignable to keyboard and gamecontroler)
lime + peote-view + (non existent yet) peote-audio 😂
do you mean "tracker" ? (that have to be simple stable lib at first for easier using)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/bulby/src/Main.hx#L16>
<http://www.maitag.de/~half/2023/bulby-tiles/>
Half, we really should do sometimes also a "rythm game" prototype into peote-samples .... best was last time that one for <@215582414544699393>
starting by _proportions_ is best into scribbling (and you can do it everywhere .. into the train, at the beach ...)
looks good!
ah
what is "artstyle" .. name of project ?
you can start also by pure lime 😂 ( thats harder but faster buildtime )
yea, its selfexplaining (also with "frameSize"!)
thank you very much!
Thats also very good sample to show how it works into changing the `@texTile` param and how to setup the texture for _tiling_ 💓
so for horizontal its: "xStart+(xEnd-w-xStart)*time0" (and then modulo cos of "pingpong")
ah, that need the same formula also out of shader then (and for input param the peote.time value then)
(that looks funny:)

have to -> autoscale
editor is not like a game-proto what runs into a game-FRAME-intoWWW
hey...
( + DPI-changes by e.g. browser-application where it runs into! )
editor have to scale to window-size!

its supercool `EDITOR`
<@694560611601743893> your new artistool is -> simple as best °°°!°!!°!°°!!°°!!!!°!!!!
(and if "not" -> better doing more into "surface" then by more other approach)
the thing also is: all lines what is "connected" have to be the same _thickness_
( the "red" one there i am tested already for ...but not had the time yet to make that _own-sample-separated_ ~_-)

and -> `lineCornerPatches`
`thickLines`
no no no ... better new folder sometimes what makes

?
🤣
`lineFPU`
maybe for pure haxe ->

<@371312079526952960> who do you wanna `name` your `folder` there ?
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/lines>
ok, better now really: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples>
(should i better create a whole folder "nanji" there ?)
ok (moment!)
this have to put into a `folder` or what do you think there ?
(would be senseful usecase for my ui also!)
e.g. to put into some XML/SVG to test out drawingmachine!
we should make a `sandbox` also for Nanji ...
(last time was -> to much "canvas"-malware inside *LOL ;:)
it would make me totally happy to see <@371312079526952960> s math-spice also again into peote-samples heap ~_~ again!
(demos also .. but not as that much into buffer-growing-size ;:)
simple samples is need!
no now .. -> entropy is -> shrinking
(into using the good haxespice and tools!)
complexity have to keep -> low
into -> complexity whats grow outside
~^
i am allways _Speaking_ about haxecode u know
not what `all` wants to have i mean!
-> make it that you are fast into (for next gamejam assets!)
keep care on that (if you make "zoom" implementation 🫀 )
the "grid" is the best into
(if code is growing!)
(never give up!!!)
YEAH 💓
whyyyyy -_- *cry

( better i am clean it up now before it allways will be like a rusty nail there into `wound` )
( its _spreaded_ around there into to much of page-tools )
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/src/peote/text/FontProgram.hx#L2685> that ones
(need to put something into 🚽 there into code at first)
(only 5 or so ... first need some core-refactoring into how i am calculate new text-page-width if a line is shrinking what was the longest line before into align [wanna make that part -> async <- ;:)])
( peote-text needs longer to put into haxelibstack ... there are need to document it first little bit [>100 functioncalls into API..wtf] )
```

s u r e
how do you did that <@371312079526952960> ?
yeah.. .that spice i mean...
(so a fork will be stable from the beginning!)
yea ... but then make all -> super-stable!
only if all works haxe-limeGL-cross
but later
or make some -> line-filling-thing inside
from kind or artist-tool i mean
lines + quads (rectangles!)
with `pixel`-quads
better combine it (but later and more modular)
`vec0 != vec1`
`point != line`
😃
then!
it is a -> `POINT`
*LOL
`line`
`null`

its this :
What do you think half ? 😂
( -> 🕳️ )
(all t h e time!)
do you know what it is ?=
if i am start painting
what i am also trapping into at first
(ctrl +/- maybe to!)
and zoom by mousewheel or two-fingeroints on touch-devices
resize-handler!
whats really more important i am think is .>
(independent of MouseControl)
move around by `input2action`-bindings ?
would it be good then to let make the cursor also
mhm... apropos "cursor"...
50% faster into _editing_ now!
(to grid!)
that -> mouse position was fixed now!
eh.. i am soo happy
_at first!_
m o d u l a r
yeah .. make it more

-> one `Element` instance <- per pixel 👀 ?
did you `r e a l l y` draw last time ... into peote-view i mean ...
eh .... by side ...

Flixel have own features at now i mean to edit glsl-fragment shadercode at runtime or what ?
(into 5 year old code and dependencies there i mean)
_mission impossible_ 😂 ?
(<https://github.com/maitag/haxe-shaderfun>)
How would be this to `realize` into <:flixel:230369617774641152> nowadays Daisy?
(also not easy to `rebuild` nowadays!)
(runs crosstarget -> but to slow)
this was (long ago) my _extremest_ hx-ui _experience_
<@829815425234632765> http://maitag.de/semmi/haxeopenfl/haxeui2-fractalgenerator-formula/?KQFvQ04ADQIpAooBTQAP/88AKHCLOPGZxkZv/sXg6fY+BQEFBAQBYQUCBAF5BQoEAXgFBAUCBAFiAAAAIEEFAgULBAF5BQoEAXg
moment.. will render some fractalimage for you (by haxeui-2proto+oldOpenFL :;)
its sometimes dependencies jungle
(haxeui-openfl-backend?)
oh nooo
*hugs ... puh
so you are a Flixel-daemon ?
(lime did let make fullscreen also for me!)
ah, so no special `samplecode` for your stuff there?
to try out you know (believing was into the _past_)
wanna `git clone`
is that maybe also -> chat ai or where i am can find your code `running` into git-web-sanboxes somewhere?
`fullscreen` after all of that ^~?
what i am only wonder you know is why you get out of
before you -> tweening it (animate-process)
(out of ...system.Capabilities.... and all the shit around)
💓
(how you are using `random` into is famous)
yeah.. thats what i am wanna see from you Daisy (^^)
<@215582414544699393> you to 👯
hey.. dont get worry (you also give good -> _assetFLOW_ <:blobcmereyou:964199768416985108> )
oh, so much you coded into ?
so i am can get `sure` you also `haxefreak`
<@829815425234632765> gimme better your `haxecode` now _then_ never ;:)!!! ! !! ! !!!! !!

so what of .. haxe to .. or something better =? ... `=?

or tell me what you `special skill` is pls (*hugs) Daisy
come one .. pls invite me to that disco-server so i am can reall asking that special one who told that what you post here into sceenshot

(what was Thomas nickname here into Disco-Chat 🦁 ?)
out of Thomas ?

The thing is .. you can develope your Tool also from the beginning (offline) into peote-net-ENV (easier to do that now than later .)

(it needs 5 years to be fully into and you also wanna learn no other programming language then!)
Half, trust into perl but not try to learn it ;)
and if you do -> then better perl6 only (that new named one!)
yeah, better not learn Perl at now *lol
FULLYSTABLE!
since 30 years
hey.. perl5 -> WORKS
or that code need time to grow into general ?
is peote-net to complicate ? (the multipaint-sample?)
"down" with what ?
(also OpenFL chat sample-application!)
what .. peote-net ?
have some into core-repo and also an independent sample-one
-> that s `pure` haxe and nobody is using *LOL
Half, but please think also about peote-net sometimes
into -> `exploration`
or ... maybe the other planets at first
and from there to the stars
but let also not zoom out to much!
🫀
at first half you have to enable zooming in/out (like <@215582414544699393> was saying also indirectly) -> by mousewheel without get lost of `pixelgrid`-painting-feeling
asset-queueueueing!
put it into -> `pipe`
yeah!
(but that totally perfect!)
and not more!
`line`-editor
better little -> `frame by frame`
(thats really need to much time to implement!)
on your Plan
you told about "inverse kinematic"
n ja
i mean
for sucha good minimal tool
endless work
fully -> animation-support <- will be
or tracker (for sure *hugs!)
(then better a blender-exporter-py for animated-json-format!)
do not do -> ANIMATION <-
(bevore existing code is growing tom uch!)))
pls do that -> multi-paint <- also some time !

woah.. do you created by Halfs-newTOOL ??? 😻
<@371312079526952960> think like another haxe-coder wanna `u s e` your stuff!
(what i am not wanna have into my _simpleSampleCode_!)
cross-hardware-specific effort
but at the other side -> Lime also helps me into DPI and all what is
(that ones of `Lime`)
my own fucking _samples_ also have to much OVERHEAD all the times
(fullyHaxeCrossCompatible!)
then show me into a 10 liner !
-> SAMPLE
-> supersimple
-> an
-> need
into my mind!
🍝
is where i am see only ax ay dx dy ....
so late here now (and also was drink some beers) .. at now the moment
What you need is -> documentation also Nanji!
cool "VectorLogic" \o/
(good API -> pure haxe!)
what need for me is a -> `usuable state`
🏝️
`xIter3`

🌊
(holy==haxe-crossover;:)
what do you are using for HOLY UI at now ?
haxeui is coolest stuff into .. but for large text and crossover also little bit slow into reactiontime
nowadays!
yeah -> userinterfaces is -> h o r i b l e
what linux do you run on thinkpad?
at first (and then on top for the single rendertargets)
math-haxe-multiplatform
mhm, sometimes i am wonder why you not make all your stuff more
~_~
ah ok .. sorry then!
are you ONLY ding Web-Code ?
`import js.Browser;`
(no shitty -> extension *lol :;)
(-> `p` `u` `r` `e` haxe M O D U L E is _neeeeeeeeeeeed_ !!! <- )
and it will draw it!
and than a little `button` -> run
for your XML/SVG-stuff
Nanji .. if you wanna .. you can also have "sandbox" later
HEY... my new TEXT-EDIT-THING also feels `faster` into
_typing_ rather than if i am writing here into electron-disco-app!
is my "text-edit-performance"-test also ok into your browser ?
(works all into neko superfast here to!)
(but al into styles .. also different sizes and sucha!)
what not is allowed is -> multiple Fonts per `UITextPage`-widget
later!
(some things into my ui-code is need to optimize, but works fast also for much of lines!)
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/edit-spinoza/
by the way Nanji ... did also rebuild the "longText"-sample to show performance:
awesome
but now an _end_ is _insight_
-> I am really spend to much years for good _integrated_ text-rendering and UI
needs line-drawing then inside of my peote-tool (glsl->fragments + formulas!)
(never did that ones yet into any!)
On my lifetime-TODO-list also is -> flame-fractalalgorithm sometimes
your cool tools that was grown over years at now!
to test out there into ?
hey, why you not make also much of samples-folders
\o/
(i mean .> aperiodic !)
what book?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling
penrose->parkett!
what your stuff will be perfect for Nanjizal would be this kind of:
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkettierung
ok, than it (new sample!) have to show the _different ways_ of _inerpolation_
(to keep the pixels!)
yeah, exactly THEREFORE it needs to -> test out!
(needs a sample TO!)
i would do "9-sclices" only by little glsl-code inside of peote-view -> Element
i am really thinking about a "star-wars"-like zooming-demo with your cool pixelassets
<@231872730478280705> aks <@694560611601743893> not me ;:) [superCOOLtoooool]... i am only *LOVE it!
cross (i am hope ... )
correct 🖖

oh.. yes ... moment:

thats a "technique" to make pre-prepared graphics (mostly into user-interfaces e.g. for buttons) better scalable. So that the up/bottom and left/right areas only scale into its directions if the whole thing will be _scaled_
🌊 🌅
-> `peote-tool`

half did sometimes also a "palette"-thing inside peote-view (was also thought about to use into samplefun there to show how _that_ works! [and i mean not "compressableOpenGLTextures!--that ones is to much GPU-specific than maybe!)])]9]]])^)]]°]
you should `split` your code into:
a) pure haxe lib part
b) cross-target rendering (started into html5-webgl-canvas)
mhm... Endian-Implementation looks like -> js only ?
abgr->argb->rgba
ah, same as what lime is also doing into graphics.Image
and thx to `HAXE-abstracts` -> that heart-operation also was not need to touch all of samplecode (all automatically "migrated" ;:)
Half, you can import Nanjizaels Graphics without effort from peote-side!
all NO-PROBLEM anymore! (all is pure haxe - data-arrays into peote-view at that point at now!)
i am using `TextureData` now there into holy NameSpace: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/TextureData.hx#L52>
\o/ all is there then!
not tested for UInt32 ones yet
yeah (did extra -> refactor <- there for better Int-Array-Input)
do you also have H-DPI-Problems ?
hi nanji 💓 🪢
(^_°)
me to
\o/
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/commits?author=maitag&since=2023-01-01&until=2023-01-22>
we have new (free) assets from <@215582414544699393> at now into testing-soup!
by the way .. if you are not know ...
no no .. better let us make some funny new peote-sample
yeah, thx to signmajesty and all the codingfreaks ♥️
maybe they only _shared_ that OpenAL-bindings into sample where you was looking at
(into gpu-accelleraTion i mean ... i am only wan'T to USE open-gl at that time!)
(the "convert"-process at that time to swf was allways to much of effort for me!)
to -> more pure OpenGL + GLSL
I am think also there was a point into history where some people want to go away from shitty flash-AGSL (adobe-own-ones) into GPU-acceleration
(only know the old "h2d" framework from Nicolas at time where nme and later openfl and sometimes later also lime ..was born)
insideOff ?
what .. heaps into lime ?
nme was better at that time
(the old one?)
do you mean h2d ?
a b s o l u t e
not that `thousands` who is using <:flixel:230369617774641152>  ;:)
much using also lime->pure
we 3 into peote (also my oldest son! ) ➕ ~7
will be not so much _confused_ anymore!
yeah, or also others who is using pure Lime
i mean: independent for a clean usage out of OpenFL->conditionals inside of code
haxelime have to be -> independent
the thing is .. also inside of lime it will be changed into next version
(mostly for openfl-users but any!)
<https://discord.com/channels/415681294446493696/457589935487189003/1037860331751477348>
we have to check if it is somewhere same into one of the peote-core-samples!
sure (not nonight -> 🍻 !!! :;)
⚔️
pls find out!
maybe peote-view bug ?
(webbrowser only scaling the webgl-canvas i am think into lime->html5)
but why the "grid" is not scaling into sync ?
or bug inside of peote-view ?
(browser-zoom and peote-View/Display zooming should be independently work!)
mhm... wait .. that is inside of peote-Display then ?
why only "nearly" ;) ?
\o/
🧘‍♂️
🙏
hey.. is it working if you are using my 3-windows configuration or not ?
° ° °°° ;:)
wonder why it here works but not inside of turbo-stone
lime is still little bit dirty into all of that (thx to openfl and flixel ;:)
try: width="0" height="0"
mhm... resizable->false only should for desktop
like there ^
there -> <https://github.com/jobf/turbo-stone/blob/master/test-app/project.xml#L10>
"0"
yeah, make it
do you have some resize-handler ?
mhm, here that works
yeah, also into new tab.. moment (will close browser completely)


firefox here works
mhmmmmhmmmm
```xml
<window width="800" height="600" fps="61" />
<window width="0" height="0" fps="61" if="html5||android" />
<window if="html5" allowHighDPI="false" />
```
i am using:
here not
and then reload browser
mhm... into my actual ui-sample it works if i am scale
😂

*LOL
🙈
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/project.xml#L29>
cos since latest new haxelib lime-version it was "true" by default (before it was "false")
( i am allways use since new lime this here : `<window if="html5" allowHighDPI="false" />` )
👍
even with it inside project.xml -> <window ..> ?
looks good!!!
( you can fetch that also by : <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/SimpleElements.hx#L35>,
so by lime: `window.display.dpi` )
<:blobcheer:964199767217410158>
How is name for your new peote-tool ?
we need then simple sample for "how to use" inside of `peote-samples` - reference
hey, if that thing is ready .. pls let us start a `peote-tools` repository
(e.g. for gamejam or to use into other demos!)
can be used into zero-time-effort
so all what is created into new editor
cool is to have a abstrahation of the thing what renders the json-data
you can slow down also the FPS
yeah.. into past peote-view could also KILL WWW-BROWSER :;)
*LOL
(will do a filebrowser then for peote-ui!)
is there maybe already some haxelib for ?
oh, yes... that would be best
ah
to keep application-code more clean
we should have that -> `fullycrosstarget`
interesting... you have to make a simple sample sometimes how you using the webbrowser-storage-thing
to only load data if its json (magic-fileheader check!)
i mean if some one drag a text-file from desktop onto browser
do you used "whatformat"-lib for this ?
coool
(for native applications it needs then another way to store ..
 .. so 2 code-branches at that place)
ah... yes, i am know that ... but then its "html-only" inside code
(like with lyapunov-generator!)
I am think for simple _drawings_ it also could be _stored_ into URL-params directly
yeah, that can be easy implemented later if you leave a dummy inside code yet

yeah, i am know ...

but had no time yet to make sample for
To make the lines more thick its also no problem (at least by little fragment-shader)
(some times there will be also better MSDF-Fontgenerator to easy prepare for any font!)
yeah.. peote-ui can be LATER
🤩
awesome
is the buttons there peote-ui ?
really good work half *HUGS
\o/
WOAH ... new DEMO ?
some other milestones will be also: tabs, auto-wordwrap and undobuffer!
if all is _stable_ then the next goal will be good syntax-highlighning
(wanna have _glowing letters_ also at the end into _styling_ 🌅 )
yeah .. that could be cool online-coloborative-editor then!
(or a chat-gpt-client *lol ;:)
e.g. -> glsl-shader-editor ... or for hscript-fun at runtime \o/
into my head all the time its still what i am can do later with that inline-editor ;)
mhmmm... something if i am add new line after last line ... not sure 😅 .... anyway ... better i am looking tomorrow and with clean head!
bug then is: if cursor goes down .. there seems a buggy "gap" between some text-lines ... don't know where it exactly appears (to locate the function inside source)
(after inserting new lines i am think by pressing enter... but not know exactly after what text operation it appears)
but there is still some ominously bug inside
http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/peote-ui/SimpleText/
By the way .. i am get my ui-UITextPage widget near to fully `editable` now:
oh noo... take care -> if you buy a fish it have not to smell fishy ;)
i am drown myself with my ui-spagetti-code often last year *lol
who did that ?

<@456226577798135808> do you need level-editor or not ?
-> inviting
for that what santa was
i am waiting every day at now
(last PR was long ago ;)
you me not so much
to do it
u gimme a motiv
_anyway_ ... totally happy to get "peote-text" so much -> nearly-finished into the last year (thanks to you also <@694560611601743893> 💋 )
in/out have to be into _balance_ again!
(ui is still not working into that if there is more than one line 🙈 )
(my focus into 2023 should be onto -> text-input)
for my simple-samplestuff i mean
me only need into glsl also
-> very good haxecode there!
for vector-graphics you have to ask <@371312079526952960>  <@440661469542219777>
+ `input2action`
or `splitscreen` at least!
from the beginning!
hey -> make all your games -> `multiplayer`
AH
(by all the new features at nowadays we have! )
what do you miss to create it again from _remembering_ into ?
(the Display have to "move" then into _offsets_!)
also
`multiplayer` by peote-net libtool
how to make that
sometimes i am asking me
do you know -> `arkanoid` ?
eh half 💓 ....

yeah!

(some day i am will use it again [or my pixel-anim there])

L A T E R :)
-> network protocol
-> optimizatio
(throught peote-net -> totally complex it would be to implement!)
what do you are started to create
for me all sound more like a `toolset`
at first!
make the `tracker` only for you!
(to old to _digg_ into supercomplex DSP for me at nowadays i mean!)
-> wanna have it -> SIMPLE
(can only use my lib and netshit for -> graphics ... need your HELP HALF to make MUSIC some DAY :;)
(but sound alone i am never can do!)
"graphics" AND "sound" !
Wanna only store something into simple -> `file-folder-structure`
and on "git" -> LOGGING
super-reduntant-persistencia is on my computer here!!!
no no nooooo
😢
-> no persistent data there
but look at my last "multipaint"-experiment
(so not for job or some of shit!)
if i am have enough of time
for me all of that is fun to create
(then you have to try out to learn the good algorithms at first!)
soundwave is a continious process
problem is -> graphics is still and 2d
so -> painting & musicmaking together!
(depend on color or some other rules!)
e.g. you paint a pixel ... and it act like a sound-source ?
is that would be possible also ?
how to integrate into multi-paint ?
or juice?
into tracker?


"c" is -> naturesound!
(how _sound-waves_ arriving)
(sry.. have to "paint" it for you my dear friend ;)

2D->soundsource :)
lib should give also only the samples what is near to some -> listener <- point ( around the "avatarchar" into 2d game to make best sound athmosphäre-feeling!)
By the way... juice also should play at least 32 samples at the same time !!!!!
<@694560611601743893> ok -> best 1024x1024 tiles (we are into `2023` at now .) ... png-compression for unused-pixeldata also it good enough!
( and `eye` - filter works more -> slow-motion <- versus 🪗 :-)
( at ear-level also more infos into a fast byte-stream -> a l l   ThE    Time ;:)
it gives best -> `result` ,) ? *lol
How to `sync` it that into middle-brain
eye -> slow
ear -> superfast
(into abstrahation for sure ;)
eye -> two dimensional
ear -> one dimensional
("see")
everyone is see it different if the brain connects them!
YEAH \o/
(like h264?)
oh, for video-audio sync into streaming ?
[gimme some wave by uint8-16-32 ... into a -> texture-data <- ...i am will sync it!!!]
hey, syncing audiowave to graphics -> np anymore 💓  !!!!!
for?
or like the piano-keys ?
or is "tracker" like the guitar-strings ?
?
how will _tracker_ be work into sync with juice-soundinstrument-lib
(i am think will be start at pure w/h-png chunks at file-lvl now [ *hugs Half ])
hey, how to you `organic` design your new tracker -> 🌉  ?
(wonder where was "lock table" .. nothing into sample there into readme ;:)
(by browsing around into haxespace)
i am looked into tinkerbell last time about this
cool !!! (many "joins" also ?;:)
or 4 times a 256^2 only ....
b) loading 16 128x128 png
a) loading 64 64x64 png
what faster is into
so maybe the real question comes over me more and more ...
(cos if new peote-net client is `entering` it have to load all `png` dynamically into depend of zoom and x/y coordinate [by url-params ;)])
if i name the files also like "a0, a1, a2 ..." or something ?
out of "save transactions" or something i mean .. is simple file-access by _filename_ maybe fast enough ?
apropos... would it be better do use sql then ?
so instead of thinking about `ADT` i am better should look at first how much little `64x64` png files i am wanna have into how much of file and folder-nesting (and how to "name" the files at minimal ;)!
<@694560611601743893> better would be an ECS-like `rule` what say: If data-amount is > 1 GB it should have to "shrink" at first !
🍝
so A1 could go to B0 ... and C1 to D0 ... and D1 back to the _roots_ ? mhm *lol
.. it allways have to "pass" the "root" if you _zoom in_!
😂 ... but then its not possible to easy zoom back anymore (if there is a `loop` inside the _graph_)
cool would be to 🪢 the endpoints then into some _randomness_ to somewhere at upper point


```
AB
CD
``` (splitting-tree!)
into ABCD - 🌳
have to scribble it (one moment 🚬 !)
<:blobidea:964199768039510067> (i am not _really_ sure how to make it a zoom-ringbuffer 😂 !)
and same into zooming
So at some amount of going to much to the left side you will arrive at the right
or we "fake" it by making it `circular`
yep
(also into moving up,down,left,right)
if there is not a special "fractal-index" of pixeldata already `painted`
Mhmm... but for usability, you are right <@694560611601743893> ... it should stop into zooming more in or out
from the beginning.
(into tree-structure to easy traverse _the changings_ up and down into _sync_!)
it should be little `64x64 chunks` or somethingLike ~_~
For best performance it have to be not at 1x1pixel-level also 😂 ....
(C should _paint_ to A and B's _background_ only!)
but client C should see both changes of what A and B is doing
this like .... client A and B is really "zoomed" into

( _pixel-changes_ from really deep zoom-level have to -> bubble up! )
what updated at clientside into background-process
so at runtime there also have to be a tree-structure (for a) and b))
not only from network-protocol .. also i am break my head about how to store the resulting ( super-large) pixeldate into many of little png-files
not necessarily
the ADT have to make that "spatial-splitting"-thing into some performant way (of loading the `tiles`)
<@694560611601743893>
i can not extend it to make it endless-zoom later!
and if i am start into b)
cos both needs totally different approach into Data-Structure
The only thing i am not sure is to make it
a) endless zooming in!
b) maximum zoom-level!
and my idea is: the smaller the brush-size -> the more its layer have to go into foreground!
the old "multipaint" really was only a test how it feels at fully sync ... next sample have to give every painter its own "layer" !

ok ... now also 2 subfolders:
i am have a new `empty` 2023 folder now on my computers here 😂 !

pure haxe is much better! (not only for lime!!!)
ah
( oh, why "lime" is crossed out there 😅  <https://github.com/jobf/juice> ;:)
Tracker also needs good sound-lib ... juice!!!
yeah, its time to let the letters _glow_ ;)
( <https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen> should be the future only-thing to _generate_ the fonts there ... also the simple tiled ones! )
me will make peote-text MSDF-compatible somewhere into 2023 (and completing the last 5% of "page"-api there to make that finished finally!)

if you think it is ready (not sure i am will use ldtk for myself ... wanna find my own blender-3-workflow at first!)
pls put also the new sample into main-branch of 🌳
hey, thats makes me really happy at xmasTimes
(then i am will _continue_ into UI ;:)
:)
puh
do you need a raylib feature also inside of p.👁️?
<@694560611601743893> sorry that i am was so much laggy into code-flow last weeks into peote-libstuff💧
(pre-rendered shadows -> and more _dynamic lights_ what only effects the _normalmapData_  instead ;)
so... best is to _fake_ this into your 2d-style ,.)
(same as complicate as into 3d)
The only thing what also not easy to calculate into 2d is -> "shadows"
without any lag!
and cool to have thousands of little moving lights into your 2d-scene
the cool is that it is fully performant by that way!
yeah, will do the 10 000 little moving lights sample definitive next year!
e.g. have some sample on todo to make many lights for normal-map (that really needs a more complex render-"queue" then!)
if i am think about "render2texture"-queue it allways _twirling my mind_ 😅
(so to only add a "post-effect" component to test the -> render2texture-queue peote-thing i mean)
to make code-abstrahation around the "post-effects" maybe this would be easier to en/disable while rapid developement then
maybe for -> level-change <- it could be useful (if i am remember last tyke-jamcode)
Half, but i am also thought at first at this <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/ecs/aidans/src/Main.hx#L55> as i am was read "entity" into ldtk-format
jo (or updating the fully buffer into sync)
All could be together with ECS also i am think ..  and the peote-view `TextureCache`
good format: <https://github.com/jobf/peote-view-samples/blob/feature/ldtk-simple/tiles/ldtk-simple/assets/world.ldtk#L64>
apropos, was also looking into ldtk-sample .. thats really easy to use this editor \o/
(looks also not trivial ... better only if it is really need ;)
or at simplest start: only a customizable "render" function for a Program-child
and some non-macro separate Shader-template
but maybe sucha custom-hook could use the "Program"-shaderspice also
jo, don't wanna blow up the Element-macro (its still a monster there and i am happy that all works!)
What maybe missing into peote-view is to have some special "Program" where you can use custom OpenGL-code inside to draw triangles or whatever you wanna without of the common `quad`-only-Buffer and vertexdata for (so also out of Element-sprite-spice then but more flexible to draw something inside of Display/Program-List!)
for all peote-haxelimeGL-targets (then it could be render2texture and used by peote .. that was my origin idea into 🌉 !)
there is superold sample, not sure it works: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/triliteral>
that would be all supercomplex then (needs <@371312079526952960> s spice then! 💓 !)
What really needs another approach i am thinking all the time about is to make it -> filled
yeah, i am remember the old line-samples also
<https://armory3d.org/community>
armory have own discord also i am think
<@694560611601743893> wow, you are also wrote a Polygon-drawer \o/ ... fantastic

take a break
and was that "_starter" helping little bit ?
if you think that it is ready to publish
keep it on your own git-account or send to my one somedays
the goal is like to make some really looking cool sample->demo

why not a combination of multiple Std.randoms ?
mhm, a `switch` is the only thing how you -> change color ?

where?
no pixel-font also ?
and i am no _fulltime_ typograph

do you also have a _handpainted_ one .) ?

then tell me better at now!
but if you wanna make only pixelart -> totallyoptimization
if you wanna experiment with textures later
you can use my pre-handmade assetdata into there!
Data -> IN/Out better into later lessons.

what do you are doing
but i can't see
whats different into ?
into writing new sample

https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/doc/PeoteView.png?raw=true
(y also)
display.xOffset
display.zoom
And was spawning 100 Elements ?
You only changed "color" at now ?
step by step
sure .. but better ->
(ok.. not the "zoom" *LOL ... but the screen-shifting ;)
you also have "zoom" and "offset" for the Display 😃 (all like on old C64!)
(the buffer can also _grow_ automatically if you give it that option on initialization)
now spawn -> 100 into a `RowCol`
SO
\o/
YEP -> `custom` constructor _on your choice!_
(by add/remove)
so 100 "Element"s should fit into
mhm, how large is your "Buffer" ?=
```haxe
var sprite1 = new Sprite();
buffer.addElement(sprite1);
var sprite2 = new Sprite();
buffer.addElement(sprite2);

sry, was into the punk-club at the corner
`sprite.c = Color.GREEN`
and before you put it into the `Buffer` make a:
ah, now look into the Main.hx here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/blob/master/_starter/src/Main.hx#L43>
i can show you how to make color custom

lemmeKnowlemmeKnowlemmeKn,..,
did you changed the _starter-code ?
anyway ... how is sample going on ?
(peer to peer ;:)
i mean i would say -> p2p
really not so good into engl. urban slang ...
so "f" is for "fanta" ?
( nice ... ascii \o/ )
tell us!
mhm, what is a "pfp" ?
(if it is simple to understand for others into code, comments and sense)
you can make a pull-request also
k
( it goes more and more optimized into that every year also ... awesome ♥️ ! )
ah, interesting .... cos not really sure nowadays
(on my old raspi2 also needs londer than 3 seconds for the greatest sample there)
hoi
and how much time is neko is need for build .. can you pls check there to
whats that ?
Do you have a really old computer ?
here it needs max 3
oh, 10 is to much
if you have a spooky hl-version or something use simple `lime test neko`!
cool .. thats also best into build/runtime performance
and what <targets> ? ( neko, hl, windows, linux, html5 ?)
ah
(still _building_ ;)=?
http://maitag.github.io/peote-view-origin/samples/RandomLetter.html
you need only to type: `lime test <target>`
( wanna _share_ my 2d-generated _textures_ at _runtime_ with armory-3d-engine there some day ! ... really !!! )
i am only need into kha sometimes
-> teamleader *lol
🙂 MoNEP, do you wanna be SEO of peote-flixel 🌉 ?
really wonder what problem into <:flixel:230369617774641152> could be
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/openfl#integrate-peote-view-inside-openfl>
mhm, into OpenFL last time it was working well
where Peote-View can only using 16 bit Shorts (2 bytes only for gpu-coord-transfer!)
e.g. into OpenFL there it is still using the _common_ 3d-matrix for
and all is 2d-optimized ( even the 2d-transformation-matrix is hand-made-optimized into main-shader of template-engine there )
but it also generates automatically shadercode ... it have its own DSL
yeah!
and put some macro-, formula, and haxespice inside also!
yes, it helps into
(cos its is not only a simple "wrapper" i mean ~_~)
or only -> "opengl-abstractionlayer for fast 2d-rendering based on haxelime"
i am think "quad" or "tile"-rendering really best fit it
oh, better would be "2d-quadrendering abstraction" instead of  -> "OpenGL abstractions"
1) init the peote-"View"
2) init a "Display"
3) init a "Buffer" what contains the Elements (aka sprites)
4) init a "Program" what using this Buffer (to hook "shader" or "Texture" for all Elements into ProgramBuffer)
5) stick all together: Program - _into_-> Display - _into_ -> View
one simple colored 2d quadratic sprite
jo
(thats newer!)
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/_starter>
yes, or into peote-samples repos  ... copy the `_starter` folder there and change code into !
what i am learned into haxelime coding at most ?
jo (more a haxeMacro 🌉 limeGl)
eh, peote-water is not that _cold_ (^_^)
(<https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/project.xml#L12>)
ah, and is all the core samples is running ?
yeah, you can really easy end into nowhere by that Element-definitions
yeah, show us some samples !
(hope not to much other lib-dependencies there!=)
ah, ok
do you have a universal json2obj-struct already for ?
i have only my old "black rain"-testdata there
don'T hurry... presents have to "pack" -> GOOD ! :;)
5-tile walkcycle + 5 tile for a simple 16x16 map or something would be coolest
If we should later create the new peote-sample MoNEP, we need a really simple test-asset created by you ( e.g. a little walkcycle or something ... graphics made by you! )
(now you know where my english-knowledge is comming from *lol !)
( best into "ldtk" subfolder at first ! )
ah, then we can make something inside of peote-sample for you if you need it !
maybe someone did this before ?
optimal would be if you are using `json2obj` library
or name it like you wan't ( i am only using "tx, ty, tw, th" into most samples there! )
you can also animate all by this (or set some "formula" ;:)
like here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/samples/src/TextureSimple.hx#L35>
if not, you have to set the texture-coordinates manually per tile (needs more gpu-ram then for the vertexbuffer!)
so if all tiles is same width/height it is the fastest way to access them

mhm, peote is doing like this:
what kind of parser for ... the extra-ldtk-data ?
never used this editor ... is it "pack" the texture-tiles and needs extra coordinates ?
k, did you get texture-atlas/tilemapping work into peote-engine ?

sry -> don't wanna make your `head` exploding
(np -> already > `implementated` 🫀)
expecially that it was not worked into <@661960123035418629> here at that night
me not forgot it
sure
you are also not found the answer to my last `try.haxe`-littleContestOrê ?
for haxebotcode i am think node is really ok cos of discointegration
<@151104106973495296> is your TODO-list for <@661960123035418629> also _growing_ up ? ( into my text-renderer it also seems like -> never ending .)
while traversing.
so all is staying into _integerspace_ \o/
`to = from + ((to-from) >> 1);` is much more _optimized_ now as into the gpt-ai-proposal
here my implementation of: -> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-text/blob/master/src/peote/text/FontProgram.hx#L1799>
And GPT-2 also did not found the best solution (only a Tip ;) cos i am using better at now:
my hope was that some ones also trying to write little optimized algorithm here but fails ~_~
<@694560611601743893> apropos, i am did that "optimization" contest with binary-traversing now by my self 😢
and you need loops for fractals (into graphically editor that is a pain to unroll them by hand!)
`geometry`-node editorsystem integrated yet.
not optimal also is that there is no `script`-node into blenders new

need a computer with 128 GB Ram for medium-quality-rendering ~_~ (have only 32)
(but new version really faster into that and more optimized also!)
jup.. need more RAM it seems
Then i am can dive much deeper again into (^_^)
Anyway, not long and they will put the new patch into where my OSL stuff can be _rendererd_ also on GPU (that for i am waiting for so long now!)
-> blender crashcrunched 😭
(will try 2048 volume resolution at now [so if i am come not back into 10 min while it generates the mesh ... ° ° ° ;:)])

woah.. by the way (i stopped "hair"-exploration at now ;) 
blender 3.4 also better rendering my mandelbulb-geomnodes now (will try higher resolution ... hope it works! \o/)
what is that ?
mhm, seems its not as easy as into old-particle-"hair-dynamics" do make it simulate to physics (like windforces or gravity) at now
blenders new hair+geometry-nodes is really awesome (wonder how it can be animated)
np, only wonder what this is about (still looking hair-tutorials ;)
culture 🙄 ?
maybe haxebot crashed cos also deepl send no answer (prbl. also was on that website there at that time i am remember)
tryed to look how things look into chinese letters
That was me.  I am remember that deepl also was not responding all the time (also by webbrowser!)

Wanna find a much more optimized algorithm for traversing my text-lines (need it to better find the line-number at mouseposition):
at now i am doing (also for chars into line!) this unoptimized way: <https://try.haxe.org/#89b5a573>
Need it also as a while-loop, so no recursive functioncall please 🙂 !
So instead of traversing the array from start to end it would be faster by starting into the middle of array ( floor(lines.length/2) ) and then choosing what side is next to traverse ( from start to middle or from middle to end )
apropos akselmo, do you wanna join little haxe-algoritm-contest at night ;-) ? (or you <@456226577798135808> ?)
(and some one need to simple `extend` your existing _code-object_ for _fast prototyping_)
depends also if you are working alone or e.g. into a team of 5 .)
then 100 lines spreaded over 20 files (arranged into 5 `sub`-folders ;)
i mean: better to have 2000 lines into one file
yeah, more fun (code-overview >= overhead ;:)
(me also more like to do -> over-performance-optimizing)
jo
(or _interfacing_ it also really powerful)
(like more the "abstract" class or "class" abstract things at now;)
me personally try to avoid inheritance into haxe often
super1... -> superN()
i mean ... what is into `super()` then ?
also into haxe-language ?
Who ever needs that .)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance
yeah, exactly!
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/InheritancePgmExampleMI.svg/370px-InheritancePgmExampleMI.svg.png
like you would `extend` a haxetype by more then one
no, i mean for "multi" ....
and also have cool <TMPL>
(forgot the "officially" name for)
multiple -> parents ?
c++ have some more into inheritance as haxe have
clang?
out of you need to use some old stable C lib
for what do you have to learn old c-spice ?
What most mindtwirling i am remember is where to put the `*` (before or after keyword)
(same way for sure!)
(into perl later it was so much easier to make pointer-fun!)
some day i did : `***` (for chess-pathfinding contest)
awesome
\o/ *hugs
excursion into 😅
where is your first: pointer of pointer
c99 ? (or ANSI 🙂 ?=)
difficult i am think is to train -> into haxe generated clientcode
or we can _feed_ gpt3-aiModel _trainingdata_ then someday with _good algorithmspice_ ;:)
(if i am have textfield editable into my ui [not long it needs anymore!] ... we can also change the fractalalgorithm [into glsl] then!)
(->bookmarked)
wow (who the hell you make the "pixel" larger? <:blobcheer:964199767217410158>)
thx (i did fit the formula little bit for you!)

( the "stars" there also much looks like simple -> lyapunov-fractal! )
oh, at _topleft_ there now more and more a julia-set is _born_ ;)
e.g. also if i am would create some _curvedate_ into blender ... it would be a pain then to convert into SVG only to read it into haxe then (for my purposes)
(also into _Versions_ and maybe need of _hacks_)
svg-`format` is to much _cryptic_ to me (not easy to handle for small samples input<-format)
i am still using my "uv-mapping" to put something into -> `curve` ;)
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/uv-mapping-spiral/>
how do you make the gradiant following the curve i mean ? (is it like into your old lib what do you are using for canvas there at now i am wonder)
or also all little tris ?
so if lines changing angle while traveling the curve... there is gaps between the neighbour lines?
not enough _ -> density <-_
looks like typical moiré pattern
(aaahhh)
mhmmmm
but no "start" and "end" variables is need i am think to make it _elegant haxecode_!
GPT really using new variable `mid` at now (so it getting _near_ ;:)
before GPT-AI will solve it _really_ at end .)
(https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/162395145352904705/1051283985042505738)
hey Nanji 🥷 ... do you also wanna _join_ my little haxe-algorithmcontest tonight ?
oh, at sucha scalefactor it really can go into limit of floatprecision then!
( even into last _contest_ i did `Std.int(Math.random()*5)` 🙈 ...sry <https://try.haxe.org/#89b5a573> )
ah (shit, forget all the time that such exists)
the black traces into are by Jackson P.)
by the way .. is there some new function into Std for random ints also ?
WOW
(thought webgl at first ... but at end this is also into some of gl-canvas)
can you change that for the html-canvas into some way ?
mhm, maybe something with texture-magnitude/minitude for scaling ?
mhm, maybe _precision_ ? (or texture-interpolation?)
no no -> looks like parametric-space
the _curve_ also looks interesting :)
it should be also congruent into naming to the other api-functions there
i am will dream of springtime

is there some _trouble_ into the bronx where i am not know about ^ ?=?
yeah.. i mean what all have to do with that what was spoken into chan-sub-branch here today/tonight i am wonder at now
oh.. what is that "poop" then ?

<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/LargeText.hx#L91>
I am need help here:
Anyway, what was last time you touched someones haxe code Bulby ?
from the _beginning_
😂 (someones would say : "headless" *lol )
you can start blender also from the shell
(no no - > davinci is not easy like how it is inside of blenders ui-friendly thing)
try Blenders `video-sequence-editor` instead !
(kde live is to complex ... i am prefare for simple things only blender!)
or WHY do you are using NOT blenders motion-picture-tool ?
(only mean how i can help you if you not say what engine it is into video-processing)
let it _flicker_
*LOL -> YEAH -> .    .. .   .. . . . . .  ....
what all of that is the `true`-ness ?
you also told something about ARMY and your parents ...
(me FULLY on `haxe` i mean)
what `language` ?
apropos, what the hell you did with `logging` here into chan last time into _posting_ =
(mhm.. my f-lang ,,, while or until ??? )
hey, -> SLEEP <- then until your brain is sober!
do you tryed out the new `HAIR` ? (intoBlenderI)
Hey Bulby (sry if i am "tell" your `name` _without a @ping prefix_)
into `HUD`
by framebuffer or somewhere .)
oh.. i am thought you mod it into some game
what 3d-engine ?
maybe you are breaking the render-queue ?
( 1.31 since july this year )
<https://ayam.sourceforge.net/>
(that one also was made by old studdyfriend of me ♥️ )
`ayam` was good!
("maya" -> totally shit)
(also sometimes "cinema" ,, but that was not open-source so i am `closed` 🚽 sometimes! ;)
(before that only real3d and pov)
i am used blender from the beginning for procedural texture generation
(or the superold "texture-plugin" `lcc` ones?)
ah, and you know my old _patch_ for ?
but for me personally -> creating fractals into blender is my profession i am think!
me was teaching all kind into blender here at some scools into the past ,,,
do you like also blender-fractals ;) ?
sure (old blender-aid irc is still alive ,.)
(since last _major_ change much of my old into brain is not working anymore ... i am at 30% of old fastWorkflow at now)
for fast `aid` ~_~
<@610250380064063497> is it ok if i am ping you from time to time if i am forgot keyboardshortcut into Blender (^_^) ?
(have also good pure haxe network-lib at now what would be interesting to see it working into ... any ... not before i am can use my 2D-haxelime also into 3d-haxeKha)
Do you know someone who could let run my 2d-gl-renderer also inside of kha-armory into _integrationprocess_ ?
(behind there is many of lime-gl-abstracts .. not sorted like into kha numerated graphics-backends i mean)
RPaladin: this is `state` at now to start a _migration process_ sometimes: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-view/blob/master/src/peote/view/PeoteGL.hx>
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/anim/rain>
e.g. wanna use my _tools_ to render something like that: <http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/rain/> into a texture for Armory3d at runtime!
(not sure how much effort is need to make it opengl-crosscompatible .. last time i am thought about i tryed to make all my gl-lime-dependencies into 1 haxe-file)
Wanna use my own haxe-stuff inside of Armory also you know!
(and also how to make my peote-view lib compatible to kha-graphic-5 [cos i am run at now only on lime-gl-es2/3])
what my brain is _driven_ from time to time is to test out the new _realtimeRAY-lighning_ of new GPU-`features` (but not until i am have sucha thing here plugged into my computer .)
*lol 🛩️ -> 🏔️
into code
fit by hand
ah.. new python version or api changes have to be _processed_ all the time ?
for me its the new BGE at now!
(was awesome even into that times [thousandTimesBetter as into early unity or others!])
(i am only used sometimes into early state .. where i am had to rebuild blender all the time)
Is it better nowadays to stay into sync with latest blender -> LTS ?
nice to see you here ❤️
(audio is your profession!)
\o/
and then -> `input2action` _in Action_ 🎮 ⌨️ 🎹
(where all totally-microsecond-is-synced [soundbuffer-playing to render`F`loop!])
seriously ... the first more complex sample for peote-view + juice should be something into -> ryhtm+game
( ok .. that with the "documentation" was _written into contract_ only cos of my age-zynism 🤣 !)
deal? *jokingly
i will write documentation for juice before and you for peote-view 😂
hey, some day we put our both libs (juice + peote-view) into haxelib at same time!
🫂
*LOL
;)
Since you are helping me Halfwheet, all is going faster and better (by your feedback into)
no other one also help me so much into find the best API-name-word sometimes into
(no other would be care into even -> _trying_ out my non-framework-conform things)
no no -> absolute best one
(into my performance-thinkingOfThatTool i mean ;:)
my engine is only running at 0.001 % then 😂
Only wonder sometimes cos its only for so minimalization into (resolution and all)
wonderful (you know how to use the peote-spice *hugsDeeply)
what ... really ? (shaderspice 🤩 ?)
mhmmmhHHmmmHMMMhmmmHmmmm

fantastic
https://github.com/jobf/lowrezjam-2022/blob/release/assets/cutScenes/level-1-preview.png?raw=true
💯 perfect
🔧
(Np!)
( is that all gets automatically if you only hover to the last versions from there i mean [now at some years later ;:)])
( or like 🍝 also there at now if something was changed into lib or maybe into testing-env ? )
is it easy to update them all without much of effort at now ?
apropos.. last time i am looked here: <https://jamesobfisher.gitlab.io/peote-samples/> (the cool actions you was codet sometimes for gitlab there into)
its `stored` savely in itch ... no ones lost!
(jam closed -> src into 🚽  ...  👍 😆 !!!)
(out of sight -> forgottn at that moment)
you also not remember ? ? ? *LOL
( or do i am to stupid to find it 🙈 )
do you not opened the sourcecode for ?
YEAH \o/
(or was it into gitlab.io ? ... sry... forget sometimes cos of so much url-bookmarks here -_-)
where was the url-link again ? .. anytime i am searching here <https://github.com/jobf?tab=repositories> i did not find the html-version ~~
... the intro was like AAA-Opener -> really 💓
<@694560611601743893> your last one (the low-resolution-screen one!) was reall awesome...
(not that some binary `poops up` my win-testingstation here 💥 :)
i am better play your jam-games instead!
not before i am not looked throught the code at all (and at that what i am was starting at some times ... it was only a short experience ,)
oh, do you mean i am should build it here for testing-purpose also ?
oh... not all hope is lost then for me
what .. really one is good git bounty branch for ?
into _easybuilding_
really thought the cool ones all using arch+i3 and would fix that 💧
... there was also many of `.bat` scripts only 🙈 [no `.sh` alternative or simple by `hxp` ... why no one of the modders help into that ... thats what i am would do at `first` into!!!] )
( as i am was looking into src of fnf-repo last hour as you posted link here into chan <@694560611601743893> ....
absolute (that env allways eating your lifetime into some simplest things!)
(without `hxp`)
I am really sad that it not run on windows 😭
`AssetMacro.wget( url, assetpath )` !
or another "large" text for trying out my new -> `testData`->assetmacro ?
(another new `hardware`-architecture???)
(steers me into haxephilosophyland _sometimes_;:)
(sry half.. my c c co _pilot_ ~_~)
🛩️
WoAHHAHA
who?
(MoNep, do you have good philosopher-text for me to use as testdata ?) [your famouset one pls!]
ah, and is the instruction-set was shrinked or why ?
is that also risk-architecture or what ?
no
-> all the haxe-tools are ready for you at now!
(also on 68040 no `real` fun anymore! ;)
yeah, since x86 it was only a pain for me!
(even into 8-bit!)
(coding into asm is really painfully .. especially if you not have the modern tools like nowadays!)
Maybe you wanna write new haxe-target for Commander_X16 (^_^) =?
and have also more "sprites" at the screen at now
hey.. SO much TODO into my HAXE-libs here \o/
*lol
how much do you pay me per hour to do that ?
into that old architecture
especially at that c128
but sometimes it needs bank-switching (long ago!)
high-ram also i am remember
(the last "bank" into scheme!)
but also some e.g. to adress the graphics and soundchip
yeah -> some `readonly`
not all of that 64 * 1024 Bytes was available for sure (rom, eprom and such was shared into 8-bit adressing-space)
(but rare .. old studdy-friend of me [we shared a room into hostle] had such one!)
(there was also a 128 version!)
*LOL
ähhh... -> 64 ?
(thats same as i am remember from my c64-times into ram banks range)
looks good!

Do you using Blender and Armory3D 😍 ?
is that maybe to let run haxe-io also locally on electron-target ?
i am wonder what all that "electron" folders is into here: <https://github.com/skial/haxe.io>
(i am think about little _ui-demo_ for philosphy-ebook-reader .. but need to fix my `UISlider`s at first 😅 )
Do you have something for the next one RPaladin ?
<https://github.com/skial/haxe.io/labels/next-roundup>
everybody can commit into!
Hey Miss Master Sandwich Pro Muffin (^_^), do you have good link to spanish philosopher text from archive.org to put into test-pagereader-sample 😅  ? (have only spinoza and sartre at now and need something into spain before i am put german-hegel into 😂)
I am most liked to see `tokentree` into list there (remembers me that some day the time is right to try it for syntax-highlightning into my text-renderstuff)
(from here: <https://lib.haxe.org/recent/>)
i thought that was _generated_ all the time ;)
<https://github.com/Dot-Stuff/flxanimate/> ?
mhm, maybe some typo cos its called like that into API
The kids also sometimes have cool new ideas that we old coders would never come up with.
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/The_Papal_Belvedere.jpg/220px-The_Papal_Belvedere.jpg

can make new `samples` then (how to get from blender into peote-view .)!
i've tryed this by old hair-tool into blender already but it never get really happens (was allways need to long time to make it looking good .. even if much was working also into gravity-physics and so on ... now its much better with `curves` there!)
(so even if the meshes looks poor it wouldn't be seen cos all is _covered by crazy animated hairstyle_ ;:)
i am think with that easier hair-obj. there at now (before it was "particle" and more complicate),
all will make more fun to create some really simple game-char-geom at first ...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmBxCK9Kpvc
I need to play around with Blender 3.3s new `hair`-system ( but first need to finish more into my haxecode for text and ui ) 😅

really creative
with
or here into my 2016-2022-fractalbestOFFshit ;:)
sorry ... nevver wannAwannaEd -> spam the macro-chan
*cures
*LOL
(what then easy can _transform_ into a -> jiukebox <- later!)
did only wrote a little e-book-reader proto
<@231872730478280705> i am really need a little -> _motivationKICK_ to finish my new ui-sample here and now _tonight_ *hugs
😃 (any .. if i am not `get` the _macroWAY_ i am really will open the `wget` 🌉  at now .)
where you have to learn how to `kill` people you don't really know
||<https://youtu.be/gGzfZUsgXMs?t=275>||
that remembers me into old song from where i am was young .)
_into_ `sync`
🪞 <-> 📱
yeah, people need more -> `real` feedback !
<@109497428926816256> what jams do you are like into ?
whats the case into casual _here_ *lol (^_^) ? _=
haxe-jam 👀  🎊  >?
🚽 <-
(my mind is at moment fully of that cos of last _textrendercoding_ here _locally_)
"metric" ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkw0QCc81ec
nah, thats seems better than the last time i am tryed
cool
(is it nowadays better there or do you allways have to think about some .net-versionizing?)
i mean for the c#-tooling ?
and was that `#mono` ever working on linux ?
access to -> `flashplayer`
of `AS3`
before -> EOL <- version
adobe also was cool into the beginning
you both needs more -> `haxe-wellness`!!! 💯
oh oh ouch (don't wanna _think_ about *hugs understanding)
the result is good! but for what of -> question ?
(at the time i am was using there was something called "heartbeat")
i mean to `sync` many databases over net
(i am only know from mysql!)
mhm... how good is maria-db nowa into _sharing between multiple servers_ ? (is there bottleneck?)
nowadays i am only would use maximal -> sqlite
-> berkley db file!
don`t use sucha shitty software <@486327776077676565> ! (or do you need for job?)
into _usuability_
ends into -> `nimbus`

all that software from ms-shit -> ticket to hell for me
never real sql like
i am only had to `convert` that shitty -> `format` sometimes for fucking-job
no free tool
excelHell

what was that _construct_ doing ?
yeah -> sometimes its better to -> `rewrite`
👍
*LOL
and do you have to -> fix 😂 ? (into c sharp)
(that can make it interesting into _artistic_ ,,, but for _productive_ normally it have to avoid!)
but between 2 or 3 -> crazyness is -> vorprogrammiert
1 is allways easy to transform into an `iterative` expression
(into nesting and _between_ other _functioncalls_ what is also -> 📞 back)
how to keep the `overview` if there is more than `one` `?
and into "break-point" ?
how do you -> serialized the output i mean for -> debugging
and how do you "log" the 2-recursive-loops (out of iteration) ?
(maybe only into c# and without -> art <- into mind)
into productive=? ... i mean ... who the hell did make it out of programming-language-art
what language ?
oh really .. interesting
recursion over one ?
did you ever tryed to write a _recursion_ over more than 2 functions ?
(only /path/ ... )
to get them all into -> haxecode <- without _Effort_ ?
and make a macro what reads the directory-tree
or should i am keep the _filenamings_ ?
to better let load into -> peote-view texture-cache
not sure to _rename_ them all by sh awk ... into -> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5 ....

http://maitag.de/semmi/haxeopenfl/haxeui2-fractalgenerator-formula/?AAB+BScAnwJFAcgCysc9WuhXC52dkgalQ+TnjkNDdUY+BQQFBAQBYgUCBQIAAACgQAQBYQUKBQQEAXgEAXkFAgQBeAQBeQ
And all of them into _different_ colors i am think would much more to see what is what into _nesting_ or _whatever_ of deep-constructing.
or if _really need_ some -> `__a`
`_a`
and then later another one into other `colored` > context
`a`
so out of e.g. make a variable name-definition of
<@903511320287150080> what i am sometimes think into _syntax-hl_ is how to give you`R` own `identifiers` its own _color-style_ (e.g some var or class or -> function-name.)

or would it be need to much time to migrate to other tools ?
do you tryed also Armory3D + Blender workflow since ?
(of into _softwarestack_ nowa i mean)
is all the ways better into the easy-ones
i mean -> the tools alone ...
(me mostly like to _bath_ into really open soft-code-bubblebath .)
oh ... badness ... owned by someother at now ?
me mostly only 2d at now
there is a good unreal-haxe-community into (or near to) seatle as i am remember

(and up on this than -> log into -> ANY)

`haxe` is better * * * -> into `microgravity`
(is there some prototypes already show to us?)
mhm, how to `daemonize` a tink-cli `haxe` then best into ?

yes, sometimes i am also think -> what the kids is using (like into old Disco-Times) -> also good for old haxecoders!

yeah -> the old mailinglist
but is it "php" or not ? (i am forgot and not wanna open fucking webbrowser now)
_little_ decentralized _networks_ .. or not ?
gnu-net, signal, matrix .. -> thats the `future`!
what the point is into -> connecting <- many chat-targets _TogEther_ over TheEther
my english language isnt so good to really understand into _realtime_ at now
-> and into _interaction_
-> little _cells_ is what _live_ it `build` is from
decentrialization is allways the better

i am only mean -> let us install a new 🌉 here!
pls copy it into here also then ! (so i am can read!)
🌉
(so i am need no -> replacement)
(thats the first i am asking myself allways into that .. but i am also not using twitter or suchathings)
is mastodon into php ?
haxe-code is -> gpl 2 or 3 ?
(will -> _resize_ it [later])
(to get away from that shitty blue-button-twitter-paywall!)

it was the guy from .. yeah
into that movie!
that was not Tom Hanks
-> `Context.parse` *LOL ?
do you have no idea for a new ... how to say ....
(it have some _spice_ into that .)
(formula is also not really an `algebra`-lib ... but maybe it can do it .)
ah, so -> math-term transforming ?
(or better s`T`ay into conversation with you)
(should i am scroll up?)
me not!
into _numberspace_ ;:)
🌳
unsigned integers and build some
you can make your own `math` by only using
Or alternatively *smiles jokingly
(or vectors or whatever -> `n`-wayDay!!!)
better use algebra then!
into the Analysis-Part of math ...
called: `complex numbers`
to `solve` that you can use e.g.
-> `both`
yeah (+/-)
the inverse operation ( `^ 1/n` )
`-` * `-` is `plus`
The problem will appear, if you have a `sytem of equatations` ... cos then you get not only 1 result anymore!
absolutely
if you make the _inverse_ operation of `^`
thats a -> `symmetry` - problem then
`-2 * -2 * -2`
e.g. think like:
and negative numbers!
into the -> `inverse` operation
but there is PROBLEM
hey
the same
2*3 == 2 + 2 + 2
jo
2^3 == 2 * 2 * 2 (three times)
e.g. the `pow` operation is maybe not -> _commutative_ anymore (not like `+`)
it have to go into `algebra` then
its the mathematical symbol for: power
-> proove it (here into our haxebot chamber pls!)

the real power is into Taylor and Polynomes
<@219549133281820672> sorry if i am was _missunderstanding_ your math-inverse-pow hint
💦
*shrUgs
<@694560611601743893> cos some part of my brain allways is into https://discord.com/channels/162395145352904705/162395145352904705/1045733554174304277
maybe i am not really was understanding <@219549133281820672> s origin question also (that could be!)
and then only : `f.bind(n);`
better would be: `var n:Formula = "n:3";`
that i am can use `^` is only cos of my cool `switch`-regexp-parsing there (like into a perl-grammar ;:)
(e.g. into js you need the "eval" command or something runtimeinterpretor)
its all programming languages
haxe not sucking into that
no
its one of my oldest haxelibs!
sure
!run ```haxe
-l formula
var n:Formula = 3;
var f:Formula = "9 ^ (1/n)";
b.bind(n, "n");
// ------
trace(f.result);
```
sry -> typo
oh -> ... the _second_ only ?
the 3.th `root` off
moment
( to try it out there before into here at realife-time .)
(its also hard cos formula is not to enable inside of try.haxe ...)
to let others also try out !!! ;:)
(half, _REALLY_ ,,, how much times i am told you
😂
*hugs deep
\o/ but <@694560611601743893> was _faster_
you are near to _resolving_
try `f.result` !
-> all at the end is a `Formula`
like my friend half sayed ...
no: `var f:Formula = "x^1/n";`
\!run \`\`\`haxe
-l formula
...
\`\`\`
<https://lib.haxe.org/p/formula>
eh, we have "formula" lib here!
also -> Taylor maybe .... <:blobidea:964199768039510067> ?
\!run \`\`\`haxe ...
why not give it a little -..-. .- ..... t  _r_ y ?
so the `inverse` of power ?
how do you like it ?
iterative or recursive ?
yeah ->  `@:for` vidyagirl
yeah, lets `implement` it (here and N O W ;:) by littleBigInts .)
pipes *lol ;:)= ?
maccaroni ?
`tracker-core` ?
and how about the "buffers" .-.. what do you need to `wrap` around for a
where is -> `tree` structure also inside ?
pipe == chain ?
i am would open `mypaint` at now to paint a little _graph_
(sry.. i am forgot the base-libs .)
```     h a l f - t r a c k e r

      \          |         /
      h a l f - t r a c k e r
```
hey -> that i am think is `your haxelib`!
yeah, maybe you should pure haxe-ui curses ones for some of your own pure haxe tracker-`ADT`s for a backend at first
but would that be going more easy if you would use some more simple and better maintainced framework for ?
What is the `complicatest` of them into all of your code-projects ?
to keep your head _free_ i mean to _contentrate_ on not to much at the same time!
if some of them are -> to old and dusty -> put into `archive` (e.g. _rename_ only prj-folder :)
At what lib you are working on at moment?
-> <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples#peote-view-samples>  " (start quick in using copy of the _starter/ folder)"
(cos its _ghostraveling_ since that into my _head_!)
i am also really near to write the taylor-series for cosinus here and now yet
for me also : if you getting stuck -> a new simple sample can help best than
You also told today Half: "best is to split into little libs" !
into my repo-wilderness ~~
i am need .)
some little -> _starter
at what targets it works and on what not
and it would be enough to only see
but at some point i am have to start into my pure peote-ui stuff at some day! (better now than never .)
no, at the end it also need another menu-navigation and all on that litte device-displays
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/SimpleElements.hx#L100>
a button have to be "auto"-sized _in_ depend of input-device!
thats is good for other things into ... but
exactly (that is only a little -> peote-view -> `zoom` hack .)
fon non-gui-things.
easy as -> cross-platform-building
not also _cross-compatible_ into -> userinterface
i mean to make the "games" and funny jam sessions and samples and all ...
(not cos of kha or lime!)
...sry..but i am feel so saaad about since so many years now
oh... also cos of maybe different SDL - version its not easy then to write something lime/kha-crosscompatible
me "know" that i am "need" but cos i am `NOT` really using that _small device touch-In/Out_ ... what should I say ? )
any .. pls gimme little push into peote-samples
YEAH
oh, if Flixel knows it .. then lime also have it includet 🙂 ?
on iphone i am don't know ( especially cos of new "metal"-shit there!)
yes
(before disco-chat!)
i am only remember discussion about that into old lime-channel
(what lime also can using then ?)
then it better needs a cross-haxeframework lib ?
i am would be totally happy if you make only 1 element there with little `DPI` class
-> cross-platform-> ,,, e.g. 300 millimeter x 200 millimeter on ANY-target-display
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples>
no no -> no one better helps me into the past out of you half !
so therefore i am need _little help_ 💧
my paper into that is absolutely -> unwritten
my mobile-device-usage into my life is near to zero
no no no -> peote-ui needs some STRICT-SIMPLE dpi-auto-adjustment
🙈
to open the configuration-menu
but if the button is to small i mean to -> activate <-
that could be on top for sure!
me also only need for -> "touch-area" for one finger-tip-size!
(no really using of lime-resize-event i mean)
but that it was into last jam-sessions
(and then itch _scales_ it _up_ for you!)
i know .. you are allways have to know the screen-size before you will start
np (sorry ~_-)=
yeah, but lets check this out into peote also (or do you using Flixel for next jam?)
(apropos, also that thing what prints out the generated-macro into that v-ide .. i am really will using that sometimes! [not long and i am will reinstall all here after that years!])
awesome
*hugs \o/
ah cool... Flixel also have that ?
(into lime -> not yet!)
i am sure only into OPenFL there is a TEST already for
we should test into peote (same as into pure lime then!)
so i am asking for _help_ (^_^) only
i am only to tired at now (and my head it full of stuff i am have to finish at first)
and then we can test it at all our targets!
we need a little `peote` sample
on iphone i am can not test here to 😢
ah.. cool ... but how is into little `s a m p l e`-`at`-`nIgHt` 😂 ?
At now there is also allways that `allowHighDPI="true"` into my <window> -settings there!
as i am remember there was a `#if mobile` into lime ... 
but is someone here was using this already to tell me where the _glitches_ are 😅 ?
Its cos i am not wanna make all ui-samples here _twice_ .. for Desktop and M.Pointer
and then another version for small mobile-touchdevices again
hey, someone know how to make a little `DPI` class-thing (pure lime!)
where i am can write then `DPI.cm(0.7)` or something and it gimme back the
exactly _size_ into `pixel` for the device-display (cross)?

<@456226577798135808> how is into _balance_ between code and result?
What is more _mazy_ .. my `haxecode` or the `result` it _prints out_ ?
-> no -> rest
66% haxe-code -> 33% maze-result (1% >`?*lol :)
(the haxecode above looks more as what it is _generating_)
17x9 i am think at now is best into _resolution_
or do you _trusting_ `pseudo` - random ?

(result is -> random .)
(code is there!)
now you!

yeah, but that was -> `TV`-times
cos this i am think is his -> perfect thing!
e.g. he should be back to make 1-5h movies (and not _following_ that `series`-streaminghype!)

aeh...
you can use my lib also `inside` a `Sprite` there (for opengl-targets only for sure)!
yeah, with openfl/flixel TileMap you can do same also!
was using echo not really for physics there also ... only to detect the distance between near `boids` (the optimization into how echo is doing that!)
thats only simple 2d
thx to `echo`-physics: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-samples/tree/master/echo>

c,c++ ➕ python for ui is best combination (you see into blender-3d how much it was improving since bind to ui there!)
yeah \o/ (you can _rewrite_ `Urwid` now also into peote-ui [+cassowary like into py-kiwi])
clang then ? (never tryed the new ones)
ah ok

logo, anyway.. how to you think my ui-code is growing up? (thx to halfwheat)
yeah ... his omage on hollywood
Why do you are asking Logo ?
the one with the one-leg-woman (coolest scene there at end ;)
so i am better not add new ui-elements there until all of that base-set is not working fully-stable into combination 🙂 !
(the both of `Text`-elements there is -> macro-generated in depend of used fontstyle 🙈 )
<@151104106973495296> so like a bunch of mixed flowers into -> ui-element-variations is possible at now 🤣
while `UIArea` is _managing_ many of `Interactive` into Array<Interactive>
but its 🍝 cos the `UISlider` is (instead of "being" an UIArea)
-> holding 2 `UIElement`-properties
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/tree/master/src/peote/ui/interactive#readme>
```
  UIArea
      \
 UIElement  UITextLine  UITextPage   UISLider  UIDisplay
         \      |      /    ___________/   ______/        
           Interactive (no "style" at the base)
```
shit, i am really have to make an `inheritance` tree there
och no 😂 (to much effort! ... would only blow up the code much more .)
have to `overide` that and throw an _error_ then!
what i am asking me now is: how to prevent someone to add a _custom_ `Program` also to the PeoteUI`Display` ?
(or we add an `UIDisplayStack` then on need .)
e.g. later if you make something for game-jam into multiple peote-view "Display"s you can also render them -> inside of peote-ui
for now its good to see where the "game-area" is _inside_ i mean (to have something there what is _moving_ it is best at now!)
(e.g. all shadre-samples of peote-samples repo into one great ui-demo!)
the cool is .. we can make a super-sample-area ... where all little samples we can _scroll-Throught_ then!
yeah \o/
dream about more -> `@anim`-variation
*lol
-> no no noooooooo (aaaaaaahhhhhhh
and good night (many dreams .. uKnow ;:)*
see you Half *hugs deep
ui-sample is also need more polishing (to better see that there is UIArea inside UIArea at now!)
np
(don't needs PR i mean .. only gimme the new elem-code ... and i will put into -> sample <-)
and you can make the Elem-class more colorful
i can try to fix the bug
from now we can work easy into `parallele`
the new holy-sample-code
no no
do you see now what i am committed into ?
jo
The real `bug` is into `UIDisplay.hx` here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/tree/master/src/peote/ui/interactive>
now we can built up on 🗼
-> sample is there at now <- (thx to Half) ...
but inside my old UIDisplay.hx code (one of the elements that can be added to an PeoteUIDisplay) is still an little bug what i am have to fix at now (or tomorrow .)
cos of `@anim` here: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/TestUIArea.hx#L27>
<@151104106973495296> and they are also moving automatically \o/
Now we have at first the "gamecode" separate from the ui-"samplecode" 😂 (one step further!)
ok, i am was putting the `Elem`-game-area into top of file and then a first test at here to get sure all is working: <https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/TestUIArea.hx#L114>

will upload ... 3 min
by a "testDisplay" ;:)
moment ... i did get some little step inbetween working
no, we do at the end : `content.add(uiDisplay)`
its only to hook some of the lower-level peote-view "Display" inside!
thats independent of "UIArea" there (into namespace)
(that one contains and masks the peote-view-display)
no no ... inside of `UIDisplay` - ui-element
(if all will work as i am think 😅 ... moment.. needa short break to relax at now!)
and into the ui-sample there is only need: `Elem.playIntoDisplay(UIDisplay.display)`
```haxe
class Elem implements Element { // Element.hx is the macro!
...
    static var buffer  = new peote.view.Buffer<Elem>(16);
    static var program = new peote.view.Program(buffer);
    
    static function playIntoDisplay(display:Display) {
        buffer = new peote.view.Buffer<Elem>(16);
        program = new peote.view.Program(buffer);
        display.addProgram(program);
        for(i in 0...4){
            buffer.addElement(new Elem(40, 60 * i));
        }
    }
```
Half, i am refactored the last one into the Elem-thing (to have all separate) , so there is now also:
it is to only have that opengl-vertexbuffer-attributes what is really used by the haxe-side
oh, thats preparing all for open-gl rendering
woah... <@694560611601743893> 🫂 ... will put it into ... moment
the goal at now is to put some peote-view `Display` also inside to simmulate->game-content!
<https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui/blob/master/samples/simple/src/TestUIArea.hx#L71>

i've started new UI-sample now to emulate a dragg-/resizable "window" 😂 :
-> best to know how to use _both_ Bulby 😺 !
haxe is a completely other _thing_ i am think ;:)
(but everyone into _scientific-work_ using the snake nowadays! [numpy])
rust can not generate python code!
this i am miss sometimes into haxe: `(filename != "") or throw(“no filename”);`
(_if_ leftHand bool is `true` it does not need to execute the rightHand-one cos of "or"-logic)
perl have much more syntaxspice for conditionals ... e.g. out of `if` you can also use `unless`, write it after the _expression_ and so on ... also code-branching can be easy by `and` and `or` boolean operations the same there!
-> perl 6 specification 😂 !
if someone wanna get more _safe_ its np to use brackets then! (but without its sometimes more fun ... especially also to make your code smaller at some points)
(thats cool syntax-sugar without brackets at places like that)
no no, better also lets write it without brackets also! ... but the last `;` then is problematic
(like _sushi_ *lol ;:)
if there is no `{}` block and only single-expression
with that nested `if` i am think the problem is: 
_from inner to out_ `or` _from outer to inner_
yeah ~_~
!run ```haxe
trace(if (Math.random()<0.5) if (Math.random()<0.5) 1; else 2; else 3;);
```
but not this:
e.g. this works:
sometimes i am wanna set a `;` .. but also works without!
can we not using haxe-compat or some easy mechanism to not break old haxe-4-libcode then ?
(oh, there its much faster!!! 8-)
ah, moment
into com.hurlant.math.BigInteger it should also be fast
(cos from 2016 and still "open" ;)
mhm, is this here still an actual _issue_ <https://github.com/Jens-G/haxe-crypto/issues/4> ?
for enum abstracts or like here: <https://code.haxe.org/category/beginner/enum-adt.html> ?
that break+argument would be useful for haxe to!
yeah, `return` then makes no sense ;)
ah.. it thinking its the "return" to the `main()` and not an _inner-one_
!run ```haxe
var x:String = { var a:String = "a"; return a+"b"; };
trace(x);
```
trace here into haxebot gives error then
`{var a="a"; return a+"b";}`
oh, is that also working ?
jo 🙈 ...sorry
ups
better would be:
sure.. it is only what came into my mind at first thought about
i heard that the loan he had to take out for this amounts to a billion dollars in bank interest every year (and the bankers not really optimistic into getting their money-investement back)
maybe same problem also into using like `if (true) 20; + 10;` or something where some `switch() {}` returns an expression on the left-hand ... 
<@539190724030103553> i am think _both_ should make to work 🙂 into future!
yeah, thats not really _Commutative_ into _Syntax_ at now!

no, i mean ...
also like old c64 ones ?

interesting would be if there is someday only 1 great `team`

<@215582414544699393> do you know how hard it is for me to not using blender yet only cos of haxe ?

pls help be Bulby to get it _happens_ (with what is into my mind to -> visualize)
all could be (blender-software is such flexible) also `timestamped` into 2 dimensions xy
<@215582414544699393> can you make a `photo` please ?
with `yourself`
to get into `sync`
at all `targets` at _once_
to _start -.=
needs weeks -> to only concentrate on that one thing you are working on i mean <-
but same into blender if there is complex scene
yeah.. coding is sometimes much easier if code not gets to much complex or spaghetti
do you know -> (thats also standalone) -> `makeHuman` `?
there is a great amount of blender-libs .. ups .. sorry -> Add-Ons .)
blender really needs much much time to learn (you can not spend to much time into chat then anymore to really get perfect into! )

thats to `complex` and fuzzy my mind at _fully_ now

for your avatar-image into our haxe-chan here 🙂 (apropos, can you also have a separate ava-img-instance on different _chans_ ?)

choosing a `Watchtower`
I am really only wonder why you Fluffy old dog....
after `multipaint` i am may will code -> `multiwrite` new sample then into that time for myself .)
(wintertime is near .)
do you also wanna come to party if you have time ?

`tigerstripes` ?
eh fluffy... do you also think my "avatar"-picture here into _Chat_ needs some
🐅
had some friend who was a dog sometimes  (was living outside of the village some years)
(that will make all much faster if the peote-net-_server_ running at same host as where the perl-one is doing its alltimejob .)
<@694560611601743893> so -> haxe 4.15 there also into some month! .-)
have millions of micro-organism on my skin and much more inside of me!
apropos, on maitag-host will be new debian also before year ends
so we can `compose` together!
you can also try to `connect` mutiple user-input for your tracker by `peote-net` ? (simmiliar to multipaint-sample)
cool
🌄
yeah.. that is was ...
yeah \o/ -> all have to be little tooools
ok (was interesting idea!)
is that already on your Plan?
exactly!
(out of `sync` to _Graphics_)
no no ... something over internet also!
you told me that!
(something like "octotracker" on Amiga .)
i mean -> something "more" than normal _modtracker_-functionality
mhm, maybe i am also did not really understand (over 🪡 -chat-🕳️) at that time...
(something into 🌉 to other input for .. what was that 🙂 ?)
you told me sometimes as you started project
where it also is -> connecting <- out of to the sample-wave-sprites or oszillo-generated
What i am not really was understanding at that time was...
your old tracker-project.. YEAH *hugs !!!!
-> and as muches as `minimal as possible` into code!
do it directly into an new peote-samples sub folder!
\o/
for a _turbulence_ of _snowflakes_ it will need another `texture` where the wind-direction vectors is stored into pixelcolor-map
<http://www.maitag.de/semmi/haxelime/peote-view-remaster/particles/>
have only `rain` at now
if you need some for next jam, pls tell me so i can put into our peote-sample-repo! :)

mhm.. was long time not browsing the glslsandbox ... there is so much SPAM now also 😢
(Bulby, please don't look at this, its not for you!) ||https://glslsandbox.com/e#92001.0||
shadertoy is for the kids (better the old sites!)

(so nobody can see some _nipple_ anymore!)
and with _bloom_ effect
we make some shader what makes all blury
*pssst

hey logo .. little jam 😂 ?
;)
awk
ah, that lib for regular expressions
wonder what `11` was there (into errorcode)

or to help <@385014891750096896> to localize =?=
do you can fix it into src ?
